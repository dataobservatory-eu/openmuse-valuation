In the 21st century, as well as in the 20th and 19th centuries, a significant portion of the European economy operates with regulated prices, where legal norms set the process by which prices are determined. It is reasonable to estimate that 30-40% of the European household spending, including practically the entire recorded portion of the music industry, operates under regulated prices that are not established through market processes. The Open Music Europe consortium has committed to collecting more data to fill various gaps, and our grant focuses on the recorded side of the music business, where market-based pricing mechanisms are absent. This is because we are dealing with the legal monopolies of copyrights and neighbouring rights.

There are two areas within the recorded music sector where price variation is present, and where supply and demand forces have a relatively direct and immediate effect on how music is paid for and how musicians are remunerated: subscription streaming services and live music. (In the context of this document, we use the standard definition of the music business or industry, which was adopted for Europe by [@leurdijk_statistical_music_2012] based on the U.S. standard model by [@hull_music_2011].)

We chose to focus on live music in Open Music Europe due to its rapid growth over the past 15 years. In the advanced music market of the United Kingdom, live music revenues surpassed recorded revenues in 2009; in Hungary and Slovakia, we observed a similar shift during the former CEEMID cooperation from 2014 to 2021.

Unlike the pricing of royalties paid to composers, performers, and producers‚Äîwhich are mostly regulated and the result of complex, politically and legally determined processes‚Äîthe pricing for live music performances and the distribution of revenue among producers and performers allows for more flexibility and negotiation among stakeholders. The price of admission to live events directly impacts revenues.

In terms of live music performances, there is one key area of the music value chain where licensing and regulated prices play a significant role: the composer‚Äôs share in live performances. This is central to our case study, which builds on the methodological research conducted in WP1.

Collective rights management agencies such as Artisjus and SOZA hold a complete or near-complete monopoly over the licensing of composer royalties for live performances within their territorial jurisdictions. These licensing activities are part of broader public performance music licensing, covering a spectrum of uses where music plays either a prominent or background role. For example, in restaurants and caf√©s, live music sometimes serves as the main attraction to draw in patrons, but often it is simply used to enhance the ambiance for extended social interactions, instead of providing entertainment beyond the usual background noise of eating, drinking, and conversing. At certain social events, such as weddings, music plays an important role. Ticketed concerts, discotheques, and mixed cultural festivals, on the other hand, often place music at the forefront of the cultural experience, with attendees paying for admission and incurring travel costs to see the show or participate in the event.

The role of the model refined in WP1 is to understand the value creation of live music and how it is divided among composer, performer, and producer revenues. We aim to refine empirical data collection methods, particularly surveys, and economic models to better capture this value.
