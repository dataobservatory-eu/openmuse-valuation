## Quantities of public events-based enjoyment {#sec-eventquantities}

```{r eventsloadpackages, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(knitr, quietly=TRUE)
library(here, quietly=TRUE)
library(tidyverse, quietly = TRUE)
library(kableExtra, quietly = TRUE)
library(snakecase, quietly = TRUE)
```

In these cases, counting hours would be very difficult. However, recalling the number of events attended is relatively straightforward. Additionally, our experience in Hungary and Slovakia in the 2010s showed that CAP surveys reasonably well corroborated event quantities when compared with other administrative sources.

In the past, we assigned a set time to events: we used 90 minutes for concerts and similar events, and 3 hours for music and cultural festivals. While we could aim for greater precision—especially with single-act performances—most ticketed performances typically fall between 60 and 120 minutes in duration.

We employed a set of questions using the ESSNet-ICET standard, asking about the frequency of event attendance in the past 12 months. Some surveys use a non-numeric, scale representation of frequency, but we found this approach less useful. Administering a scale is neither simpler nor "cheaper" than asking for a number, and the distribution of responses was so skewed toward 0 or 1 that the scaling significantly distorted the values. However, we do have enough data to rescale the results to estimate the likely value of a scale representing 3-5 or 6-10 visits.

Given the very low frequencies, with median values typically being 0 or 1 in most European countries, we must assume that the usual frequency of attending such events is less than annually for most countries and demographic groups. Therefore, we asked respondents to recall the time of the last concert they attended. We believe this framing is useful, even though the annual cycles of concerts (with about 25% of concerts taking place in December) can make frequency calculations imprecise. However, this approach allows us to collect additional data, such as ticket prices and external costs (e.g., travel expenses) related to a specific, well-remembered event.

For less music-focused events, where music plays a secondary but still important role (such as visiting shopping centers, restaurants, cafés, and hotels), the averages are higher, but the median values remain low. The majority of the Slovak and Hungarian population does not spend a single night in a hotel in a year, and about half of the population does not visit a restaurant. Sadly, a significant portion of the Hungarian and Slovak population lives in areas where there are no restaurants or similar establishments at all.

The primary question remains the CAP visiting frequency question in these cases; however, there are ways to refine the numbers and make them comparable with other statistical sources. For example, stays at hotels are available for both domestic and foreign visitors in nearly every settlement or at the national level.

#### Model question for event quantities

The top level question base type is the CAP "How many times in the last twelve months have you been to a `concert`?", where `concert` can be replaced with any type of event. In our demo database see [Q2957](https://reprexbase.eu/demo/index.php?title=Item:Q2957) It is an instance of (or example of) a question as defined by the DDI standard: [question (disco) (Q1295)](https://reprexbase.eu/demo/index.php?title=Item:Q1295).

-   The `value representation` of this question is `numeric base type`, which means that we expect some sort of a machine-readable number to this question.

-   The type of event is linked to this question by the `concept reference` property[^eventquantities-1] an entity such as a question, variable, or data point to the concept it is intended to express, measure, or be about. The question above refers to the concept of a [concert (Q1435)](https://reprexbase.eu/demo/index.php?title=Item:Q1435).

-   The question text is attached to this question in two languages; it is clearly stated that Hungarian version of this question is `Az elmúlt tizenkét hónapban hány alkalommal volt koncerten?`.

[^eventquantities-1]: This property links an entity such as a question, variable, or data point to the concept it is intended to express, measure, or be about.

It is crucial that all concepts are clearly defined in all languages of the survey and are understandable to the respondent. The professional challenge is to use language descriptions for these concepts that are general enough to avoid confusion, yet specific enough to ensure the responses are categorized correctly in the model.

#### Visiting frequencies to cultural events

`EB79.2_QB1` *How many times in the last twelve months have you* $$performed the following visiting activity$$ ?

In the CAWI version of SINUS, these questions have a scale representation with the following scale.

$$Answer items$$: `Not in the last twelve months`, `1-2 times`, `3-5 times`, `More than 5 times`, `I don’t know`.

In the Open Music Europe SK, HU 2015 surveys we will use a numeric representation with filtering potentially exaggerated, outlier values.

**Subquestions with visiting activities resulting in the following variables**

-   [ ] Seen a ballet, a dance performance or an opera

-   [ ] Been to the cinema

-   [ ] Been to the theatre

-   [ ] Been to a concert

-   [ ] Visited a public library

-   [ ] Visited a historical monument or site (palace, castle, church, garden, etc.)

-   [ ] Visited a museum or gallery

-   [ ] Watched or listened to a cultural programme on TV, on the radio or in a podcast.

-   [ ] Read a book

*Some of these questions are not directly important for music organisations, however, they help to calibrate the survey and to better understand concert visiting demographics, because cultural activities are very highly correlated; for example, usually the same target groups visit concerts, theatres, and cinemas; or the same target groups by records and books.*
:::

#### Typology for measured quantities

::: callout-note
### CAWI music typology

Sinus used the following typology in the CAWI questionnaire:

-   [ ] Been to a DJ night at a nightclub, bar, disco, etc.
-   [ ] Been to bar or pub with live music
-   [ ] Been to a restaurant with live music
-   [ ] Been to a music festival
-   [ ] Been to a culture festival, fair, or other public event with live music
-   [ ] Been to a dinner show, variety show, theatre performance, etc. with live music
-   [ ] Been to a private event with live music (wedding, party, etc.)
-   [ ] Live-streamed a music performance online
-   [ ] Attended a virtual music event in the Metaverse / in augmented or virtual reality
:::

`concert` : any ticketed or unticketed event where an important or main attraction of the event was the performance of a musician, a band, a DJ or other musical group.

`festival with music`: any ticketed or unticketed festival, where several music events, or various cultural events took place, but the performance(s) of musicians, band(s), a DJ(s) or other musical group(s) was an important part of the event.

`restaurant`: any establishment where an important purpose of the stay is to consume food and drinks, irrespective if the place is serving pre-made fast food, or food from a menu, or but the establishment has a kitchen and can prepare food.

`café or pub`: any establishment where the main purpose of the stay is to meet friends, colleagues by a drink. They may serve snacks, even food, but the main purpose of the stay is not eating out.

`hotel or hostel`: any establishment where the main purpose is to provide lodging for at least one night, regardless if it is a wellness hotel, a hostel for affordable stay, or a business-travel oriented establishment.

`church or place of worship`: any establishment where the main purpose of the visit is worship or the participation in religious activities which may involve the use of liturgical music.

A potential qualified version of the question is:

-   "How many times in the last twelve months have you been to a `concert` `alone`?"

-   "How many times in the last twelve months have you been to a `concert` with `a romantic partner or spouse as a couple`?"

-   "How many times in the last twelve months have you been to a `concert` with `a group friends or family members` ?"

The advantage of the extended question that it clearly refers to one visitor (one ticket), two visitors (two tickets), and multiple visitors (multiple tickets). Such a question formulation is particularly useful if we ask if the respondent paid for the ticket(s) and what was the value of the total purchase.

With cultural events, the event is often paid by somebody else, such as a parent, romantic partner, or the municipality, so the visiting quantities and ticket purchasing transactions do not match up well.

The taxonomy or conceptualisation of "hotel", "fast food", "restaurant" should be as detailed as data is needed and available. Because we want to collect some quantities from surveys, grouping is necessary. It is not a problem if one data source (for example, the survey) is not as detailed as the tariff table and the internal revenue source, however, grouping (taxonomy) should be well designed. For example, if we only have "restaurants" in one data source it must be clear that restaurants = "restaurants" +"fast food outlets" in the other source.

## Revenues from mechanical licensing

  webshot2::webshot(html_file,

}
```

Our usual data sources had been the *IFPI Global Music Industry Report*, the reports of Mahasz and SLOVGRAM. We may have some data from author's right societies mechanical rights data, but it is likely not very complete.

-   Mahasz publishes their data in separate datasets for physical and digital sales, see for example [@mahasz_fizikai_2024]

-   The Slovak market data are published by IFPI CZ, see for example, *Tisková zpráva: Výsledky trhu 2024. Slovensko* [@ifpi_cz_slovakia_2024]

The CISAC data collection has the following mechanical rights categories. They may be available for the society that does the valuation, or some sort of estimation needs to divide aggregated data. For example, in our case, the Radio+TV aggregate is not useful, because we decided to put together all television end-uses, regardless of retransmission or broadcasting.

```{r cisacmechanical, echo=FALSE}
readxl::read_excel(here::here("data-raw", "cisac_data_sources.xlsx"), 
                   sheet="mechanical") %>%
  mutate_all(as.character) %>%
  mutate_all(.funs = function(x) ifelse(is.na(x), "", x)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

DJ Licensing may not be available, but if it is, it is related to foreground music. The sale abroad and locally is important for our model; we want to compare market revenues within a country. If such a separation is not available, then we can estimate it with the help of the CISAC table about reconciliation with sister societies (revenues sent abroad and received from abroad.)

::: callout-warning
#### Consultation Decision

We do not have neighbouring rights societies that are cooperating with us, and we inquire with IFPI about the academic licensing fee of the Global Music Report. This will be done by EUBA.

In the absence of cooperation with IFPI, we will rely on the data published by IFPI CZ about Slovakia and Mahasz about Hungary.
:::

In this case, we also must make assumption on the use of unlicensed copies, such as private copying and illegal copying. It is a source of revenue for mechanical licensing, and it directly relates to the listening hours of mechanical copies.

## Revenues from public performance 1

-   For radio, television, cable retransmission the main information source are the author's societies and neighbouring rights societies.

-   For streaming, we would need data from the recording side, or the IFPI GMR report, because author's societies have very limited knowledge. Although we generally know what is the ratio of author/producer's rights, author's societies do not represent the entire repertoire.

## Revenues from public performance 1

-   For concerts, we have a full license list, but we need to assess if we can use this information, and if there is any unlicensed market segment.

-   How precise information is available for us about prices?

-   We can to some extend rely on CAP and music professionals surveys.

-   what is the situation with discotheques and other foreground music, where we can assume that the people visit the event mainly for music.

-   In the case of background music, we should work with estimates based on total number of establishment, licensed/unlicensed ratios, and CAP survey data on visiting frequencies and audience size.

We want to collect information about concerts and other events' qualitative or quantitative properties. In the previous sections, we talked about concert or restaurant visits in general and in the plural form. We ask about the last event in singular and specificity and ask questions about this event. We ask about the last visited event, which is the easiest to recall.

#### Last concert

Our model question from the CAP 2015 Hungary: `Mikor járt utoljára zenei rendezvényen (koncert, fesztivál, diszkó, zenés gálavacsora)?`

We want to collect information about concerts and other events' qualitative or quantitative properties. In the previous sections, we talked about concert or restaurant visits in general and in the plural. We ask about the last event in singular and specificity and ask questions about this event. We ask about the last visited event, which is the easiest to recall.

-   `Time appellation`: What was the last time the person visited a concert? (For example, last week, last month, in 2024, in 2023, in 2022 or earlier.) The time appellation is relative to the time of the fieldwork. The relative time appellation is helpful to cross-check visiting frequencies; for example, if the last concert visit was 24 months ago, then the person could not have visited three concerts in the previous 12 months.
-   `Ticketing`: Was there an entry fee or paid ticket required (to categorise ticketed and "free" concerts)?
-   `Who paid for the ticket?`: - Understand the prevalence of people visiting concerts who did not pay for themselves.
-   `What was the ticket price?` - A ticket price quantification in the local currency.
-   `The location of the event`: understanding travel economic and environmental costs and barriers to visits. We must know from the respondent geography the usual location of the respondent.
-   `How did you travel to the event`: typology to be used for ESRS-E1 transport impacts.

For `WP3`: - `Can you tell me a few things about the waste collection in the concert?`: ESRS-E5 indicators: there were disposable cups and plates and no recycling collectors; there were disposable cups and plates and with plastic and paper recycling; there were no disposable cups available; etc.

-   `Can you tell me more about the type of music played in the concert?` Follow up only for indigenous or authentic folk, world music, which relates to ESRS-S3: Was there authentic folk music played; was it played by members of the indigenous community themselves; did it make a good, neutral, or positive impression on the culture of the community?

#### Last catering visit

Our model question from the CAP 2015 Hungary: `Mikor járt utoljára zenei rendezvényen (koncert, fesztivál, diszkó, zenés gálavacsora)?`

We want to collect information about catering venue visits to understand the visiting demography, purchasing power, and the role of music in such visits. In the previous sections, we talked about concert or restaurant visits in general and in the plural. We ask about the last event in singular and specificity and ask questions about this event. We ask about the previously visited venue, which is the easiest to recall.

-   `Time appellation`: What was the last time the person visited a restaurant, café, pub, or other similar catering establishment? (For example, last week, last month, in 2024, in 2023, in 2022 or earlier.) The time appellation is relative to the time of the fieldwork. The relative time appellation is helpful in cross-checking visiting frequencies; for example, if the last restaurant visit was 24 months ago, then the person could not have visited 7 restaurants in the previous 12 months.
-   `How many persons did you pay for ?`: - Understand the prevalence of people visiting concerts who did not pay for themselves. Model question: *What was the ticket price? How many pieces did you purchase for yourself or for somebody else?* (See [concert ticket price and quantity (question) (Q2958)](https://reprexbase.eu/demo/index.php?title=Item:Q2958) from CAP 2015)
-   `Paid amount`: Was the amount you paid at the establishment for these people? (See previous model question.)
-   `The location of the venue`: understanding travel economic and environmental costs and visit barriers. We must know from the respondent geography the usual location of the respondent. Model question: [settlement of establishment (quesetion) (Q2965)](https://reprexbase.eu/demo/index.php?title=Item:Q2965)
-   `Can you recall the music played in the establishment?`: yes, no, there was no music.
-   `What did you like about the music?` It fitted the atmosphere, the volume was good, it made us feel safe that we are not overheard, there were no commercial breaks.
-   `What did you not like about the music?` It did not fit the atmosphere, the volume was too loud, too low, it did not make us safe that we are not overheard, there were too many commercial breaks.
-   `Travel cost`: model question: [average music event travel costs (question) (Q2961)](https://reprexbase.eu/demo/index.php?title=Item:Q2961), to understand the monetary and time value sacrificed for going to a concert, beyond the ticket price.
-   `How did you travel to the event`: typology to be used for ESRS-E1 transport impacts.

For `WP3`: - `Can you tell me a few things about the waste collection in the restaurant?`: ESRS-E5 indicators: there were disposable cups and plates and no recycling collectors; there were disposable cups and plates and with plastic and paper recycling; there were no disposable cups available; etc.

-   `Can you tell me more about the type cuisine of the restaurant?` Follow up only for indigenous or authentic cuisines, which relates to ESRS-S3: Was there authentic cuisine of an ethnic group or minority served; was the music of this ethnicity or minority played; did the overall experience make a good, neutral, or positive impression on the culture of the community?

#### Last hotel or hostel visit

Our model question from the CAP 2015 Hungary: `Mikor járt utoljára zenei rendezvényen (koncert, fesztivál, diszkó, zenés gálavacsora)?`

We want to collect information about hotel or hostel venue visits to understand the visiting demography, purchasing power, and the role of music in such visits. In the previous sections, we talked about visits in the plural. We ask about the last event in singular and specificity and ask questions about one particular hotel visit. We ask about the last visited venue, which is the easiest to recall.

-   `Time appellation`: What was the last time you stayed in a hotel or hostel? (For example, last week, last month, in 2024, in 2023, in 2022 or earlier.) The time appellation is relative to the time of the fieldwork. The relative time appellation is helpful in cross-checking visiting frequencies; for example, if the last hotel visit was 24 months ago, then the person could not have visited 3 hotels in the previous 12 months.

-   `How many persons did you pay for ?`: - Understand the prevalence of people visiting concerts who did not pay for themselves.

-   `Paid amount`: Was the amount you paid at the establishment for these people?

-   `The location of the venue`: understanding travel economic and environmental costs and visit barriers. We must know from the respondent geography the usual location of the respondent. Model question: [settlement of establishment (quesetion) (Q2965)](https://reprexbase.eu/demo/index.php?title=Item:Q2965).

-   `Can you recall the music played in the establishment?`: yes, no, there was no music.

-   `What did you like about the music?` It fitted the atmosphere, the volume was good, it made us feel safe that we are not overheard in the lobby or restaurant, there were no commercial break, we could listen to our own music in the rooms, we could listen to radio or pre-selected music in our rooms.

-   `What did you not like about the music?` It did not fit the atmosphere, the volume was too loud, too low, it did not make us safe that we are not overheard, there were too many commercial breaks, we could not listen to our own music in the rooms, we could not listen to music at all in the rooms.

### Other comparisons

A less detailed but nevertheless useful comparison is revenue sources among GESAC/IFPI societies. The total revenue from restaurants, for example, is a weighted average revenue from different restarant categories.

$$
r_{restaurant} = w_1 * r_{cat_1} + w_2 * r_{cat_2} + ... + w_{n} *  r_{cat_n}
$$ While this revenue should can be different among the countries of Slovakia, Netherlands, Estonia, the difference must not be arbitrary, because of the single market hypothesis and the relevant jurisprudence, revenue differences among these countries must be explained by objective economic variables.

*l* = *licensed restaurant rate*

$$
l_{A} < l_{B}
$$

If country A and B have similar number of tourist visits, purchasing power for restaurant services, and restaurants, than the revenue for restaurant licensing should be mainly explained by the fact that in country A only 60% of the restaurants are licensed, and in country B it is 80%.

Or, if we do not know the licensing rate, but country A has twice the consumer spending per inhabitant then country B then we should expect significantly higher revenue in country A then B.

$$
r_{restaurant} ~ l*n_{restaurants} + l*pp_{restaurants} + l*n_{tourists}
$$ This type of comparison is not suitable for establishing what should be the rate that restaurants are paying. However, if we find that Slovakia has a higher number of restaurants, higher consumer spending for restaurants, and a higher number of tourists than Lithuania (a similar-sized country), yet revenues are below that of Lithuania, then it would be justified to increase revenues in Slovakia. It is also true, that given that rightsholders must not be discriminated negatively just because they happen to live in Slovakia, in Slovakia we must increase the revenues if they are lower below explainable differences.

Such econometric comparisons can be seen as a reality check, or a corroborating evidence to whatever results we receive from other sources.

### Engaging with live music questions

2 Engaging with live music (N=1000): 10 min The next few questions are about live music events. By “live music events”, we mean any live performances by singers, musicians, or DJs who are featured by name (not just as background music).

11. On a scale of 1 to 5, how important would you say live music events are to you? \[PROG: Single response\] • 1 Not very important – honestly, I can do without live music • 2 • 3 • 4 • 5 Very important – I don’t want to imagine a life without live music

12. ARTISJUS_2015_Q3_1 When was the last time you attended a live music event? \[PROG: Single response\] • This or last month • In January, February, or March 2025 • In October, November, or December 2024 • In July, August, or September 2024 • In April, May, or June 2024 • In January, February, or March 2024 • In 2023 • Before 2023 • I don’t know / don’t remember

## CISAC Data Tables

Our key interest in this case is background music, and the CISAC data classification works as follows:

```{r cisacperforming, echo=FALSE}
readxl::read_excel(here::here("data-raw", "cisac_data_sources.xlsx"), 
                   sheet="performing") %>%
  mutate_all(as.character) %>%
  mutate_all(.funs = function(x) ifelse(is.na(x), "", x)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

Generally, the public performance in restaurants, hotels, is available only as an aggregate called "background music". We need to work with at least the the data from concerts and discotheques.

If radio and television is grouped, then television should include broadcast and retransmission revenues (like in the case of mechanical rights revenues.)
