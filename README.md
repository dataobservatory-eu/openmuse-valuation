> This is a living document which provides an overview of `D1.2`, which is a linked open data database supported by applications. As a living document conforming to OPA, it can be found at <https://github.com/dataobservatory-eu/music-economy-register> with standardised folders and file names. Its current version can be read in multiple formats [here](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/documents/open_music_europe/music-economy-register/).

This repository uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to generate a technical book. Most of the book can be edited in any markdown editor, but it is recommended to use RStudio or Quarto for contribution that includes codes. The key chapters include:

-   `index.qmd`: Introduction and overview

-   `glossary.qmd`: Key terminology

-   `musiccomparators.qmd`: Overview of the background and model variables

-   `surveying.qmd`: Surveying and building register datasets

-   `references.qmd`: Bibliography and references

The documentation is continuously updated to support the development of linked open datasets and practical register management tools.
