## Context & Objective {#sec-pilot-context}

This pilot study is developed in the context of a complex and, in several respects, problematic research project, where planned data deliveries and formal analytical components were not provided by research partners as originally foreseen. As a result, the pilot serves both as a methodological demonstration and as a defensible reconstruction of what can be achieved with limited, fragmented, or incomplete inputs. The emphasis is therefore placed on transparency of assumptions, reproducibility of methods, and robustness of the analytical framework, rather than on the completeness or authority of any single dataset.

The analytical framework used in the pilot is the market comparator model. This model relates observed or estimated quantities of use to observed revenues in order to infer implicit or shadow prices, allowing comparisons across uses, markets, or territories. In music markets, where prices are often unobservable or embedded in bundled and zero-price business models, the market comparator model provides a coherent way to compare value across heterogeneous forms of consumption.

The immediate objective of the pilot study is to demonstrate the application of this model using a fully specified but synthetic dataset. Rather than relying on sensitive or proprietary data, the study constructs a complete set of revenue and quantity tables for a hypothetical country, Livonia. This allows the full analytical workflow to be shown end to end, including data reconciliation, aggregation, and interpretation, without exposing confidential information or creating incentives for reverse engineering.

A central design goal is transferability. The model, data structures, and computational workflows are intended to be reusable in any EU Member State, subject only to limited local reconciliation reflecting national institutional arrangements. The pilot therefore prioritises stable, internationally comparable categories and avoids country-specific refinements unless they are essential for conceptual coherence.

Throughout the pilot, the focus remains on the method and the model rather than on publishing results about any real country, organisation, or market. The synthetic example is used to demonstrate how authorised users, with access to their own national data, can apply the same approach to generate meaningful comparative insights within their own legal and institutional constraints.

## Synthetic data construction and safeguards {#sec-pilot-synthetic}

To support reproducibility while fully respecting the confidentiality obligations of participating collective management organisations, all empirical examples in this pilot are based on **synthetic datasets**.

In addition to the fictional territory of Livonia, we introduce a second fictional country, **Pomerelia**, named after a historical duchy that is today fully absorbed into Poland. Neither Livonia nor Pomerelia corresponds to any contemporary state, collecting society, or institutional arrangement.

The authors’ rights revenue data for both fictional countries were constructed as **linear combinations of aggregated data patterns** drawn from the 2023 and 2024 annual reports of Artisjus (Hungary) and SOZA (Slovakia), with the explicit purpose of avoiding disclosure of any real society’s data. The specific weights used in these combinations are undisclosed, and additional stochastic noise was introduced. This design ensures that the resulting datasets remain economically realistic while preventing reverse inference about the actual strengths, weaknesses, or collection structures of any real collecting society.

As a result, while the synthetic Livonia datasets resemble one real society somewhat more closely and the synthetic Pomerelia datasets resemble another, the combination of undisclosed weighting and random noise makes it likely that an entirely different CISAC member society could exhibit closer similarity. Year-to-year changes between 2023 and 2024 in both fictional cases are **purely random** and do not reflect the actual collection dynamics of either Hungary or Slovakia.

For readability and comparability, total authors’ revenues were normalised to approximately **€10 million per year for Livonia** and **€20 million per year for Pomerelia**. These orders of magnitude do not correspond to the actual scale of either Artisjus or SOZA. The fictional authors’ societies are therefore referred to as **LIVA** (Livonia) and **POLA** (Pomerelia).

Neighbouring-rights revenues were constructed using the same synthetic approach, but with lower granularity. For valuation purposes, no confidential data were available from neighbouring-rights organisations such as MAHASZ or EJI in Hungary, or SLOVGRAM in Slovakia. We therefore created simplified but realistic revenue tables for the fictional neighbouring-rights societies **LIVPERF**, **LIVGRAM**, **POLPERF**, and **POLGRAM**, sufficient to support comparative analysis without exposing sensitive information.

The aim of these hypothetical datasets is not to approximate any specific national market, but to provide a **fully reproducible, analytically valid example** that mirrors real CISAC-aligned reporting structures while respecting legal, ethical, and contractual constraints on data disclosure.

### Livonia and Pomerelia {#sec-pilot-livonia-case}

Livonia is introduced as a fictional territory used exclusively for the purposes of this pilot study. The name is derived from the historical *Duchy of Livonia*, a former region in the eastern Baltic area, but the contemporary entity described here has **no real-world political, economic, or institutional counterpart**.

The use of a fictional territory is deliberate. It enables the construction of synthetic datasets that closely follow real-world reporting conventions—particularly CISAC-aligned structures—while ensuring that no sensitive data can be inferred, attributed, or reverse-engineered. All revenue figures, quantities, distributions, and growth patterns associated with Livonia are artificial, even where they are calibrated to resemble plausible European scenarios.

This deliverable is supported by several datasets and a data paper; they contain a *Livonian Music Database* for the diversity-related D2.3 deliverable. This actual dataset is not synthetic, it contains recorded music data concerning vocal music in the Liv language, which is the heritage of Livs (in English, often referred to as Livonians), an autochthonous ethnolinguistic group historically associated with the eastern Baltic region. That usage reflects a separate methodological ambition: the development of statistical indicators below the national level, including for sub-national regions, minority cultures, genres, or other specific market segments.

The fictional Livonia used in this section is **not associated** with the Livs, their culture, or their historical territory. The name is employed solely as a neutral, non-identifying label for a synthetic case study designed to illustrate methodology, not to represent any real community or institution.

Similarly, the reference to a historical region of Poland, Pomerelia, only reflects our ambition to extend our Slovak and Hungarian valuation to Poland at one point; no data from Poland was used for this pilot report.

### Using this deliverable as a computational notebook

The following R packages need to installed next to the R statistical environment and language:

```{r requirements, eval=FALSE}
require(dplyr)
require(readxl)
require(here)
require(tidyr)
require(knitr)
require(kableExtra)
```

The `here` package is used to establish the root folder of your working repository. Provided that you forded our OPA-compliant GitHub repository, you will find the synthetic data assets in its `data` subfolder that you access on your computer, regardless if you use a Unix, Mac or Windows system with `here()` that will construct a relative path according to the syntax of our operational system.

For loading the synthetic CAP survey data:

```{r loadcapdata, eval=FALSE}
synthetic_cap <- readxl::read_excel(
  here::here("data", "synthetic_cap.xlsx"))

# ------------------------------------------
# We do not need separate ad-supported and |
# premium stream data so we collapse them  |
# into a single category                   |
# ------------------------------------------

synthetic_cap_reduced <- synthetic_cap %>%
  mutate(source = ifelse(
    source == "ad_stream", "stream", source)
    ) %>%
  group_by(source, country, year) %>%
  summarise(hours = sum(hours, na.rm=TRUE))
```

For loading the synthetic CISAC- and IFPI aligned revenue data:

```{r loadrevenuedata, eval=FALSE}
synthetic_revenues <- readxl::read_excel(
  here::here("data", "synthetic_revenues_26.xlsx")
  )
```

## Data Sources

Within the Open Music Observatory, we distinguish two subclasses of statistical concepts for revenue-related data.

In the Open Music Observatory data model, these variables are treated as *statistical concepts*. Their primary source, however, consists of *administrative royalty accounting data* provided by collective management organisations (Artisjus and SOZA). As a result, the variables correspond both to statistical concepts and to accounting concepts.

To avoid parallel or duplicated conceptualisations, variable definitions explicitly reference:

-   **IFRS** (International Financial Reporting Standards), applicable to accounting data across EU member states; and\
-   **ESA 2010** (European System of Accounts), which governs statistical variables derived from administrative and accounting data sources in the EU.

CISAC-aligned data (`CISAC-aligned authors’ royalty revenue concepts`) used in this pilot study originate from authors’ royalty collections in Hungary and Slovakia. For methodological testing and illustration, we also generate synthetic data for the fictitious territories of Livonia and Pomerania.

IFPI-aligned data (`IFPI-aligned recorded music revenue concepts`) describe recorded music revenues by market segment and territory, following the classifications and aggregation logic used in IFPI global and territorial reports.

CISAC- and IFPI-algined data are recorded under a common valuation basis (market prices), with source-specific interpretations documented in methodological notes.

### Authors’ Revenues {#sec-pilot-authors-revenues}

Authors’ revenues in this pilot study are represented using CISAC-style royalty tables, which provide a highly standardised view of how authors’ rights are collected and accounted for across Europe. These tables are organised by rights category (reproduction and performing rights) such as radio broadcasting, digital uses. They distinguish between gross collections, deductions, and distributable income. The emphasis of the model is on this reporting structure rather than on the absolute levels of revenue, as the structure is what enables comparability across countries.

Artisjus in Hungary and SOZA in Slovakia are used as structural references because their published reports follow the CISAC reporting conventions closely and illustrate the range of categories that typically appear in authors’ royalty accounting. They serve as practical examples of how CISAC-aligned data are organised, not as sources of values to be reproduced. In the pilot study, their structures inform the design of the Livonian authors’ revenue table, while the numerical values are altered and synthesised to prevent any inference about the real revenues or internal distributions of these organisations.

Accordingly, the analysis focuses on how revenues are grouped, aggregated, and reconciled within the CISAC framework, rather than on the specific financial outcomes of any collecting society. This allows the market comparator model to be applied in a way that is transferable across countries, while respecting the confidentiality and sensitivity of real-world authors’ royalty data.

We treat CISAC-aligned data sources as administrative data sources for statistical aggregation.

CISAC-aligned data (`CISAC-aligned authors’ royalty revenue concepts`) used in this pilot study originate from authors’ royalty collections in Hungary and Slovakia. For methodological testing and illustration, we also generate synthetic data for the fictitious territories of Livonia and Pomerania

The conceptual structure applied to CISAC-aligned variables is:

`CISAC-aligned authors’ royalty revenue concepts` ([omo:Q2079](https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2079))\
┣ `recording context`: accrual basis ([omo:Q2082](https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2082))\
┗ `valuation context`: market prices ([omo:Q2087](https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2087))\

The `recording context` (in these cases, accrual basis), and `valuation context` (in these cases, gross basis) are added with the `has measurement context` property qualified with a subclass of a `recording context`, like `valuation basis (SDMX)` ([omo:Q2084](https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2084))

An example of such variable representation is `gross mechanical royalty revenue from radio use (authors)` ([Q2055](https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2055))

### Neighbouring Rights Revenues {#sec-pilot-neighbouring-revenues}

Neighbouring rights revenues in this pilot study are described using IFPI-style market reports, which present the recording-side view of the music economy. These reports focus on revenues accruing to producers and, indirectly, performers from recorded music, typically broken down by format such as physical sales, downloads, subscription streaming, ad-supported streaming, performance rights, and synchronisation. Unlike CISAC-aligned tables, which are organised around uses and rights categories, IFPI reporting is market-facing and format-driven, reflecting how recorded music is consumed and monetised.

The *Global Music Report 2025: State of the Industry* provides a comprehensive global overview of recorded music revenues, trends, and market structures from the perspective of producers and the recording industry. It presents harmonised revenue figures across countries and regions, broken down by major formats such as physical sales, downloads, paid and ad-supported streaming, performance rights, and synchronisation, and highlights long-term structural shifts in consumption and monetisation. While the report focuses on aggregate market outcomes rather than rights-specific accounting, it establishes the global benchmarks, definitions, and classification logic that underpin IFPI-aligned national reports. In this pilot study, the *Global Music Report* serves as a conceptual and structural reference for how neighbouring rights revenues are categorised and compared internationally, rather than as a direct source of values to be reproduced [@ifpi_state_of_industry_2025]. Industry stakeholders typically have access to the full *Global Music Report*, which contains market data for all IFPI national jurisdictions (“territories”).

*Music in the EU 2025: A Growth Engine* provides a European-level perspective on the recorded music sector, situating IFPI-style market data within the broader economic, cultural, and policy context of the European Union. The report complements the global view of the *Global Music Report* by focusing on the role of recorded music in the EU economy, including market size, growth dynamics, employment effects, and the contribution of music to the digital single market. While it draws on the same underlying IFPI-aligned revenue classifications, its emphasis is on regional aggregation, policy relevance, and comparative performance across EU Member States [@ifpi_eu_music_report_2025]. In this pilot study, the report is used to contextualise neighbouring rights revenues within the EU framework and to support the plausibility and scalability of the synthetic Livonian data as representative of an EU-style recorded music market.

The Hungarian and Slovak contexts are used as calibration references rather than as sources of values to be replicated.

In Hungary, Mahasz publishes an extensive historical series of recorded music market data aligned with the figures reported to IFPI for the *Global Music Report*, and has made these data publicly available in spreadsheet form since 2003, albeit with some structural changes over time. This long time series illustrates how IFPI-aligned reporting can be implemented consistently at national level and reused for analytical and modelling purposes.

For the purpose of this analysis, we used the physical sales data *Mahasz 2023. évi fizikai eladás adatok* \[Mahasz Annual Physical Sales Data 2023\] and the same dataset for 2024 [@mahasz_physical_2024; @mahasz_physical_2025]) and the *Mahasz 2023. évi digitális eladási adatok* \[Mahasz Annual Digital Sales Data 2023\] and the same dataset for 2023 ([@mahasz_digital_2024; @mahasz_digital_2025].) Mahasz's excellent statistics provide an invaluable panel data, but curiously do not contain the public performance revenues, that we imputed from the annual reports [@mahasz_annual_report_2024; @mahasz_annual_report_2025].

In Slovakia, the *Výsledky trhu 2023: Slovensko* \[Market Results 2023: Slovakia\] and the similar document for the year 2024 provides country-level recorded music market data published by the national IFPI affiliate [@ifpi_slovakia_market_results_2024; @ifpi_slovakia_market_results_2025], following the same classification logic as the IFPI *Global Music Report*. Unlike global or regional summaries, this document offers direct insight into the structure and scale of the Slovak recorded music market, typically presenting revenues by major format such as physical, digital, and streaming. As a publicly available national annex, it demonstrates how IFPI-aligned data can be accessed at country level even when the full *Global Music Report* is not available. In this pilot study, the Slovak report functions as an elementary data source that illustrates how national market figures can be used to calibrate and validate the structure of synthetic neighbouring rights revenue tables without relying on confidential or proprietary datasets.

For the purposes of the Livonian example, the emphasis is on the recording-side perspective and its compatibility with the market comparator model. IFPI-style data provide observed revenues by market segment and format, which can be aligned with measured or estimated quantities of use. The pilot study therefore applies IFPI reporting logic to construct synthetic neighbouring rights revenue tables for Livonia, ensuring that they are consistent with publicly observable market structures while remaining sufficiently abstracted to avoid disclosure of sensitive or proprietary information.

IFPI-aligned data (`IFPI-aligned recorded music revenue concepts`) describe recorded music revenues by market segment and territory, following the classifications and aggregation logic used in IFPI global and territorial reports.

These variables are also treated as *statistical concepts*, independent of contractual or royalty-based interpretations. Their conceptual structure mirrors that used for CISAC-aligned data:

`IFPI-aligned recorded music revenue concepts` ([omo:Q2077](https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2077))\
┣ `recording context`: accrual basis ([omo:Q2082](https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2082))\
┗ `valuation context`: market prices ([omo:Q2087](https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2087))\

A key methodological distinction between the two data families concerns the *price reference point*, which is documented at dataset level rather than encoded structurally in the data model:

-   IFPI-aligned data reflect retail-level values as reported in IFPI market statistics.
-   CISAC-aligned data reflect gross licensing fees collected from users (e.g. broadcasters and venues).

### Quantities {#sec-pilot-quantities}

Quantities in the market comparator model are derived from *Cultural Access and Participation* (CAP) survey data. These surveys are used to approximate how recorded music is actually consumed across different contexts and channels, including radio, television, streaming platforms, user-uploaded content services, and listening at home, at work, or while travelling.

CAP surveys are designed to measure participation in cultural activities rather than to capture transaction-based usage. In many areas of music consumption, directly observable quantities are not available. In such cases, CAP surveys provide a structured, well-established, and widely accepted source of information on patterns of use.

In this pilot study, quantities are operationalised as *nominal listening hours*, derived from survey responses and aggregated to annual values. These measures act as proxies for use intensity rather than as precise estimates of absolute consumption. They are subject to known limitations, including recall bias, survey design effects, and the constraints of self-reported behaviour.

For the purposes of the market comparator model, absolute precision is not required. The model relies primarily on *relative proportions of use across channels and contexts*. There is no strong reason to assume that these proportions are systematically biased across uses within the same survey framework. As a result, nominal listening hours provide a suitable basis for allocating quantities when comparing revenues and inferring implicit or shadow prices.

The CAP surveys used in the *Open Music Europe* project follow the methodological principles established by ESSNet-Culture, in particular the ICET model, which is recognised as best practice for measuring cultural participation in Europe. This ensures conceptual alignment with official statistics and comparability with other national and European cultural participation surveys. The questionnaires, variables, and harmonisation principles are documented in the Open Music Europe *Data Management Plan* and related methodological deliverables.

Within the project, two CAP surveys were conducted and were intended to be processed through the Open Music Europe statistical software ecosystem. For the purposes of this pilot study, however, only the raw contractor files were available. The data are therefore used solely for illustrative purposes.

CAP-derived variables are employed to generate *synthetic Livonian and Pomerelia quantities* that mirror realistic listening patterns, without disclosing or reproducing any sensitive or project-internal data.

### Synthetic Data {#sec-pilot-synthetic-data}

In this pilot, the Cultural Access and Participation (CAP) survey’s core enjoyment transaction—listening to music—is operationalised as notional listening hours. Individual responses are aggregated using post-stratification weights to represent the national population. The resulting values are not behavioural measurements of specific individuals, but statistically weighted population estimates suitable for macro-level comparison and modelling.

The synthetic CAP-derived tables express notional listening hours across five dimensions: source, situation, country, year, and hours. Listening sources include ad-supported streaming, premium streaming, downloads, physical formats, radio, television, background music, discotheques, and concerts. Situations distinguish listening at home, during travel, at work, and at events. Country coverage is limited to the synthetic territories of Livonia and Pomeralia, and the temporal scope covers the years 2023 and 2024. The hours variable represents aggregated, weighted notional listening time for each combination of dimensions.

This breakdown reflects the operationalisation of the CAP survey developed by Reprex, drawing on experience from five national CAP surveys in Hungary, two in Slovakia, and one in Croatia. In response to increasingly ubiquitous smartphone and portable device use, the survey design emphasises listening situations (home, travel, work) and attendance-based contexts (concerts, discotheques, and other venues with background music) to improve recall accuracy and reduce respondent burden. This structure supports realistic consumption patterns while remaining compatible with synthetic data generation and downstream market-level reconciliation.

## Key Modelling Decisions {#sec-pilot-key-modelling-decisions}

The modelling framework was developed within the CEEMID cooperation among Hungarian, Slovak, and Croatian authors’, producers’, and performers’ rights stakeholders, as well as organisations representing audiovisual and image rights[^pilot-4]. Variants of the framework have been applied in different contexts: publicly and in simplified form in Croatia [@antal_pcr_croatia_2019], in advocacy-oriented industry reporting in Slovakia [@antal_slovenskom_hudobnom_2019], and most extensively in Hungary. In the Hungarian case, the framework was implemented under a voluntary commitments procedure with the national competition authority, following a preliminary inquiry into pricing practices. This report is not public[^pilot-5].

[^pilot-4]: The Open Music Europe project grew out of the Central & Eastern European Music Industry Databases (CEEMID) initiative in 2014 [@artisjus_measuring_2014], in which rightsholders from three countries attempted to solve these data problem, and bring seemingly data poor Central European countries to a level of data availability that allows better price setting or the creation of better creative industry policies or business strategies.

![An example of an analysis in Hungary in 2019.](png/full_market_example.jpg){fig-align="center"}

The recognised fair valuation principles stipulate that the "most applicable method" must be used in valuations, which almost always leaves out in copyright valuations the (historical) "cost approach" and leaves open the use of the "income approach" and the "market approach". The cost- and income approaches are fundamental valuation techniques and could be used to reset valuations or prices fully.

The *cost approach* is inapplicable because the rightsholders are natural people who do not account for their working time, i.e., the time when they are composing music.

The *income approach* compares the royalty flows of a work of its recording by using an appropriate "discount rate." The income approach is often impractical when we have irregular or annual payments. With annual payments, the valuation's timeframe would be too long. Calculating an appropriate discounting rate would also be practically impossible for many uses. This approach is more suitable for analysis within a rightholder organisation, such as a music publisher or record label that has long-term, consistent and frequent income data.

The *market approach* tries to identify a payment rate, regardless of if it is made in a lump sum, monthly or annually established, based on sufficiently similar uses. As often seen in various jurisdictions from the EU to Canada or the United States, the market approach is often used in copyright tribunals and other contexts, because the other two approaches are lacking reliable data inputs. It is often used for comparing valuations, or estimating acceptable prices or royalty rates when it can be assumed that at least some of the prices are correct on the market.

The market comparator model presented here, unlike the cost or income approaches, is not a fundamental valuation method, and many modelling decisions, and usability limitations (see @sec-pilot-limitations) must be considered in use.

### Total Music Value vs Rightsholder-Specific Value

A central modelling decision in this pilot study is to focus on the total value of music, rather than on rightsholder-specific values for authors, performers, or producers. The primary objective of the market comparator model is to relate observed or estimated quantities of use to observed revenues in order to infer implicit prices. From this perspective, the economically relevant object is the total value generated by music consumption, irrespective of how that value is subsequently distributed among different categories of rightsholders.

There is no *a priori* correct or universal split of music value between authors, performers, and producers. The division of revenues reflects legal frameworks, collective bargaining outcomes, contractual practices, and historical institutional arrangements, all of which vary across countries and over time. Even within the European Union, where copyright law is partially harmonised, neighbouring rights and collective management practices differ substantially between jurisdictions. Treating any particular split as normative would therefore introduce assumptions that are external to the market comparator model and not supported by observable market behaviour.

Focusing on total music value has important implications for data aggregation. Revenues from different rights categories and collecting entities must be aggregated across authors’ rights and neighbouring rights, and quantities of use must be defined in a way that is consistent across these domains. Prices are then interpreted as average or shadow prices per unit of use, rather than as contractually specified tariffs for individual rights. This approach allows the model to remain agnostic about institutional detail while still producing meaningful comparative results, and it makes the framework more robust and transferable across countries with different rights management structures.

### Stock–Flow Conversion and Temporal Normalisation of Use {#sec-pilot-stock-flow}

A further central modelling decision concerns the conversion between stock-based and flow-based measures of music consumption and revenues. The market comparator model requires quantities and revenues to be expressed on a common temporal basis. In music markets, however, different uses generate revenues and are measured over fundamentally different time horizons, creating a stock–flow mismatch that must be addressed explicitly.

Some music uses are naturally observed as flows. Streaming, broadcasting, and most forms of public performance generate revenues that accrue continuously and are typically reported over monthly or annual accounting periods. Corresponding quantities, such as streams, airplay counts, or listening hours, are likewise flow variables that can be aggregated over a year without conceptual difficulty. In these cases, the alignment between quantities and revenues is relatively direct.

Other uses, particularly mechanical reproductions such as physical sales or permanent downloads, generate revenues as one-off transactions, while consumption unfolds over a potentially long period. From the rightsholder’s accounting perspective, the relevant revenue is realised at the moment of sale and recognised fully in the accounting period in which it occurs. From the user’s perspective, however, the purchased recording may be consumed repeatedly over many years, implying a long-lived stock of listening potential with diminishing marginal use over time.

The modelling choice adopted in this pilot follows a flow normalisation approach. All quantities are converted into notional annual listening hours, irrespective of whether the underlying use is based on a one-off transaction or a continuous service. This reflects the observation that, at the aggregate level, listening in any given year is supported by a mix of newly acquired recordings and recordings acquired in previous years. Purchases made in earlier periods continue to generate listening in the current period, while purchases made in the current period will generate listening in future periods. Under stable consumption patterns, these effects tend to offset each other, allowing annual listening hours to be treated as a consistent flow measure.

This approach is consistent with standard practices in time-use accounting and avoids the need to specify detailed assumptions about asset lifetimes, depreciation schedules, or discount rates for individual recordings. While alternative formulations are possible—such as explicitly modelling the useful life of recordings and amortising revenues over time—these would introduce additional parameters that are difficult to observe and would not materially improve comparability for the purposes of the market comparator model.

Different categories of use nonetheless retain distinct economic characteristics and are therefore kept separate at the quantity level. Streaming, broadcasting, public performance, mechanical reproductions, and live performances are each associated with different pricing mechanisms and institutional arrangements. By maintaining separate quantity aggregates for these uses while normalising them to a common annual time basis, the model allows implicit prices to differ across uses in a way that reflects real economic differences rather than artefacts of accounting conventions.

In this sense, the stock–flow conversion is not a technical adjustment but a substantive modelling decision. It enables revenues recognised within a given accounting year to be meaningfully compared to contemporaneous patterns of music consumption, while preserving the heterogeneity of uses that is essential for interpretation and policy relevance.

### Market Definition {#sec-pilot-market-definition}

The modelling framework presented in this pilot study is informed by analytical traditions that are also used in competition law and regulatory contexts, particularly in assessments of whether prices or remuneration levels can be considered fair, equitable, and reasonable (FER). In several European jurisdictions, market comparator approaches have been employed by collecting societies and regulators as one of multiple tools to assess pricing practices, often in the context of investigations or negotiated remedies rather than formal infringement decisions.

The CEEMID framework was developed and refined in settings where competition-law considerations were explicitly present, most notably in Hungary, where its most detailed implementation formed part of a voluntary commitments procedure following a preliminary inquiry by the national competition authority. In that context, the model was used to support transparency, proportionality, and consistency in pricing analysis, rather than to mechanically derive or impose tariffs. This history informs the design of the framework but does not define its scope in the present pilot study.

It is important to stress that the market comparator model, as applied here, is not a legal test and is not intended to substitute for competition-law analysis. Competition law requires case-specific assessment, including consideration of market power, counterfactuals, efficiency justifications, and legal standards that go beyond quantitative comparison. The present pilot does not claim that its outputs can be directly used to establish FER compliance or non-compliance in a legal sense.

Nevertheless, the model rests on a shared analytical premise: that meaningful comparison requires a well-defined market concept. This includes clarity about the relevant product or service scope and the relevant geographic scope. Without such definition, prices, quantities, and revenues cannot be aligned in a way that allows economically interpretable comparison. The model therefore adopts an explicit, operationalised notion of the market as a necessary precondition for comparison, even though alternative definitions may be equally valid in other analytical or legal contexts.

From a geographic perspective, the model assumes that meaningful comparisons can generally be made at the level of a copyright jurisdiction, which in most cases corresponds to the territory of a national polity. This reflects the territorial nature of copyright and neighbouring rights and the way in which royalties are collected, accounted for, and distributed. From a product perspective, the model requires explicit decisions about which uses of music are included, such as licensed uses versus exceptions, and how boundaries are drawn between different forms of audio content.

Within these boundaries, the market comparator model provides a structured way to relate revenues to use and to infer implicit prices. These inferred prices are best understood as economic signals, not as normative benchmarks. They can highlight relative differences across uses, markets, or territories and can support discussion about proportionality and consistency, but they do not, on their own, determine what is legally or contractually appropriate.

By making these assumptions explicit, the pilot study positions the model as a transparent and adaptable analytical tool. It can inform policy discussions, regulatory dialogue, and internal assessment by stakeholders, while leaving legal interpretation and enforcement to the appropriate institutional frameworks.

### Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Conventions {#sec-pilot-segment-conventions}

A key modelling challenge arises from the fact that authors’ rights and neighbouring rights are reported using different conceptual and accounting frameworks. *CISAC-aligned data are organised around legal rights and modes of use, such as public performance, broadcasting, mechanical reproduction, and private copying*. This rights-based logic reflects how collective management organisations account for and distribute royalties to authors and publishers.

In contrast, *IFPI-aligned data adopt a market-based perspective, structuring revenues by product format and channel*, such as physical sales, downloads, subscription streaming, ad-supported streaming, performance rights, and synchronisation. These two reporting logics are internally consistent but not directly comparable without further reconciliation.

The category commonly labelled as “Digital & Multimedia” illustrates this mismatch particularly clearly. In CISAC-style tables, Digital & Multimedia may appear under both performing rights and mechanical reproduction rights, reflecting the coexistence of communication-to-the-public and reproduction components in digital uses. In IFPI-style reporting, the same underlying consumer behaviour is captured through market segments such as downloads or streaming, without explicit reference to the underlying legal rights. As a result, Digital & Multimedia functions as a cross-right category in rights-based accounting, while appearing as a unified market segment in recording-industry data.

To apply the market comparator model, these differences must be reconciled conceptually. *This does not require a perfect one-to-one mapping between CISAC and IFPI categories*, but it does require a consistent aggregation logic that aligns revenues and quantities at a comparable level.

In this pilot study, reconciliation is achieved by abstracting from legal distinctions where necessary and focusing on economically meaningful units of use. Rights-based categories are aggregated to match market-based segments, or vice versa, using documented assumptions and, where available, external calibration sources. This approach allows the model to bridge institutional reporting differences while remaining transparent about the assumptions involved.

### National and Domestic Revenue

A fundamental and often underappreciated issue in applying market comparator models to music markets concerns the territorial interpretation of revenues reported in national datasets. Both CISAC-aligned authors’ reports and IFPI-aligned national market reports are commonly read as describing activity “in” a country. In practice, however, they often reflect a mixture of domestic and foreign consumption, depending on institutional reporting conventions and data availability.

In principle, IFPI national market reports are intended to capture revenues earned in a given market, *meaning revenues generated by consumption within the national territory*. Under this interpretation, streaming revenues would ideally be split between domestic consumption and export revenues generated abroad. In practice, such a distinction is rarely observable in published data. National IFPI affiliates typically aggregate the total revenues reported by their member labels without systematically distinguishing whether streams occurred domestically or in foreign territories. As a result, national market figures for streaming tend to be de facto national-by-affiliation rather than strictly national-by-consumption.

A similar ambiguity exists on the authors’ side. In CISAC-aligned reporting, *revenues from foreign uses are often visible only in aggregated form as royalties received from sister societies, either gross or net of reciprocal deductions*. For domestic uses such as radio and television broadcasting, the territorial logic is relatively clear: usage occurs within the country, is monitored domestically, and is licensed and accounted for accordingly.

By contrast, digital uses—particularly streaming—are less clearly territorialised. When a platform reports streaming data to a collective management organisation, *the reporting may be based on repertoire affiliation rather than listener location*, or on contractual outsourcing arrangements for digital collection. As a result, digital royalties received by a national society may include significant foreign consumption without being explicitly labelled as such.

From a modelling perspective, this creates a tension between two conceptions of the market: a territorial market defined by place of consumption, and an institutional market defined by affiliation or repertoire ownership. *Publicly available data sources often sit somewhere between these two conceptions*, without fully satisfying either. This is not a flaw of any single dataset, but a structural feature of how digital music markets are organised and reported.

In this pilot study, the ambiguity is treated explicitly as a limitation rather than resolved through strong assumptions. *Revenues are interpreted as national in the sense of being reported by national institutions, not as strictly domestic consumption measures*. Quantities derived from CAP surveys, by contrast, are inherently domestic, as they measure listening behaviour of residents within a country. The model therefore aligns domestic quantities with institutionally reported revenues under the pragmatic assumption that, at an aggregate level, export and import effects partially offset across uses and periods.

This assumption is more defensible for some uses than others. For broadcasting and most forms of public performance, the territorial alignment between use and revenue is relatively strong. For streaming and other digital uses, it is weaker, and the resulting implicit prices should be interpreted with caution. The model does not claim to measure the value of domestic consumption in a strict economic sense, nor the global value of a national repertoire. Instead, it provides a consistent framework for comparing reported revenues to observed patterns of use within a defined institutional scope.

Recognising this limitation is essential for interpretation. It also points toward possible extensions of the model, where micro-level royalty statement data, platform-side reporting, or distributor datasets could be used to disentangle domestic and export components more precisely. Such extensions, however, require access to data that are not publicly available and are therefore beyond the scope of this pilot.

### The Problem of Streaming {#sec-pilot-streaming-problem}

Streaming poses a particular challenge for the market comparator model because the revenues it generates cannot be cleanly split across rights categories without introducing additional assumptions. From the perspective of consumer behaviour, streaming is experienced as a single, integrated mode of access to music. From a legal and accounting perspective, however, the same act of streaming simultaneously involves multiple rights, most notably authors’ performing rights, authors’ mechanical rights, and neighbouring rights for producers and performers. The way in which the total value of streaming is divided among these rights is not directly observable in public data and depends on contractual arrangements, collective management practices, and national legal frameworks.

This highlights a fundamental distinction between consumer-facing measures and rights-based accounting. CAP survey data, platform usage statistics, and market reports capture how listeners engage with streaming services, but they do not reveal how streaming revenues are allocated internally among different rightsholders. CISAC-aligned reports reflect the outcome of this allocation for authors’ rights, but they do so only after internal distributions have taken place and without exposing the underlying splits between different components of digital use. As a result, CISAC public reports do not provide sufficient detail to reconstruct the full streaming value chain, and such information can only be obtained through internal analysis by a CISAC member organisation.

By contrast, IFPI-aligned data provide a clearer public picture of streaming on the recording side. In Hungary and Slovakia, where public IFPI-aligned reports are available, streaming revenues are typically reported as a distinct market segment, often further divided into subscription-based and ad-supported streaming. These figures reflect the total recording-side revenues generated by streaming services in the national market and are directly comparable across countries. However, they do not distinguish between the various authors’ rights components that coexist within the same streaming transactions.

In this pilot study, the gap between consumer behaviour, market-level reporting, and rights-based accounting is addressed through the use of proxies and external calibration. IFPI streaming revenue shares are used to anchor the recording-side value of streaming, while CAP-based listening proportions provide information on relative usage patterns. Where necessary, informed assumptions are introduced to reconcile these sources at an aggregate level, with the explicit understanding that such assumptions can be replaced by more precise country-specific data if and when authorised internal information from collective management organisations becomes available.

## Replication Strategy {#sec-pilot-replication-strategy}

The pilot study is accompanied by a set of spreadsheets that closely resemble the type of data a national consortium, collecting society, or sectoral organisation would typically have access to. These spreadsheets mirror the structure of CISAC- and IFPI-aligned reporting tables and the derived quantity tables used in the market comparator model. They are designed to function as templates rather than as sources of real data. We recommend that, in practical implementations, such data be placed within a secure data-sharing environment governed by appropriate access controls. Within the Open Music Europe framework, both the Slovak and Hungarian federated modules foresee such data spaces in their data models and are designed to exchange harmonised tabular data, even when the underlying values cannot be publicly disclosed.

The replication strategy therefore separates method from data access. The published materials demonstrate how the model operates, how different data sources are reconciled, and how outputs are produced, while allowing national or sectoral users to substitute the synthetic Livonian inputs with their own authorised datasets. This approach ensures that the computational workflow can be reused without modification, while respecting confidentiality constraints and legal obligations associated with real-world data.

### CISAC-Aligned Data {#sec-pilot-cisac-replication}

For the purposes of replication and cross-country comparability, the individual CISAC-aligned variables listed above are not analysed in isolation, but are grouped into use-based aggregates that reflect how authors’ revenues are reported and compared within the CISAC framework. The guiding principle is that functional equivalence across countries is more important than fine-grained national distinctions.

#### Why CISAC alignment matters

Alignment with CISAC reporting categories is critical because it provides one of the few internationally stable, operationally validated classification systems for music rights revenues that is already embedded in real-world accounting, distribution, and governance processes. From a policy perspective, CISAC-aligned data operationalises several of the core requirements articulated in the Copyright Infrastructure Task Force (CITF) framework: authoritative identifiers, lifecycle-aware aggregation, and auditable provenance of rights-related data.

At the same time, CISAC alignment makes music data legible to cross-domain initiatives such as the EU Culture Data Hub, where comparability, transparency, and methodological consistency across Member States are prerequisites. Rather than introducing a parallel or music-specific accounting logic, CISAC alignment allows music-sector data to plug into emerging European data infrastructures using categories that are already recognised by collective management organisations, statistical offices, and policymakers, thereby reducing translation costs and governance friction.

#### Radio use

For authors, the economic value of radio use is represented as the sum of:

```{r radiocisac, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
radio_royalty_variables <- tibble::tibble(
  label = c(
    "gross performing royalty revenue from radio use (authors)",
    "gross mechanical royalty revenue from radio use (authors)",
    "gross royalty revenue from radio use (authors)"
  ),
  omo_id = c("Q2056", "Q2055", "Q2054"),
  url = c(

  )
)

tbl_no <- next_table_number()

  "fig-%02d-valuation-pilot.png", tbl_no)

  dplyr::mutate(
    concept_variable = paste0(
      label, " (omo:", omo_id,")")
    ) %>%
  dplyr::select(concept_variable, description) %>%
  kbl(
    caption = fig_caption,
    booktabs = TRUE
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", 
                          "hover", "condensed", 
                          "responsive"),
    latex_options = c("hold_position", "scale_down"), 
    full_width = FALSE) 

save_kbl_if_needed(kbl_obj = radio_cisac_vars_tbl,
                   path = fname,
                   figure_dir = save_dir)

render_kbl_or_image(kbl_obj = radio_cisac_vars_tbl,
                    path = fname,
                    figure_dir = save_dir)
```

The performing and reproduction streams together capture the total value of radio exploitation ([omo:Q2054](https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2054)) accruing to authors under collective management.

```{r showscisacradio, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
tbl_no <- next_table_number()
fname <- sprintf(
  "fig-%02d-valuation-pilot.png", tbl_no)
fig_caption <-  sprintf(
  "Table %02d. Radio use data in the synthetic datasets", tbl_no)

radio_rows <- synthetic_revenues %>%
  mutate_all(as.character) %>%
  filter ( grepl("radio", variable_name))

radio_tbl <- radio_rows %>%
  select (-variable_name, -uri) %>%
  kbl(
    caption = fig_caption,
    booktabs = TRUE
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", 
                          "hover", "condensed", 
                          "responsive"),
    latex_options = c("hold_position", "scale_down"), 
    full_width = FALSE) %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1,
                     "Livonia" = 2,
                     "Pomeralia" = 2)) %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "8cm") %>%
  column_spec(2:5, width = "2cm")

save_kbl_if_needed(kbl_obj = radio_tbl,
                   path = fname,
                   figure_dir = save_dir)


render_kbl_or_image(kbl_obj = radio_tbl,
                    path = fname,
                    figure_dir = save_dir)
```

If the analysis is extended beyond authors to include neighbouring rights, additional estimates are required. In that case, radio use must also include:

-   gross performing royalty revenue from radio use (performers), and
-   gross performing royalty revenue from radio use (producers).

Mechanical royalties do not apply to performers and producers in the context of sound recordings and are therefore excluded on the neighbouring-rights side.

#### Television use

Television use follows the same aggregation logic as radio. For authors, total television value is constructed by summing:

```{r tvcisac, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE,  , results='asis'}
tv_royalty_variables <- data.frame(
  label = c(
    "gross performing royalty revenue from television (authors)",
    "gross mechanical royalty revenue from television use (authors)",
    "gross royalty revenue from television use (authors)"
  ),
  omo_id = c("Q2058", "Q2059", "Q2057"),
  url = c(
    "https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2058",
    "https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2059",
    "https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2055"
  ),
  description = c(
    "gross royalty income accruing to authors from the public performance and communication to the public of their works in television services, before any deductions; this consolidated category includes royalties from terrestrial television broadcasting, satellite television, cable retransmission, and, where applicable, web-based television services",
    "gross royalty income accruing to authors from mechanical rights related to the reproduction and fixation of their works for television services, before any deductions; this consolidated category includes revenues arising from terrestrial television broadcasting, satellite television, cable retransmission, and, where applicable, web-based television services",
    "total gross royalty income accruing to authors from the use of their works in television services, before any deductions, consolidation adjustments, or cost offsets; this is a consolidated revenue category covering terrestrial television broadcasting, satellite television, cable retransmission, and, where applicable, web-based television services"
  )
)

tbl_no <- next_table_number()
fname <- sprintf(
  "fig-%02d-valuation-pilot.png", tbl_no)
fig_caption <-  sprintf(
  "Table %02d. Television-related royalty revenue variables (authors)", tbl_no)

tv_cisac_vars_tbl <- tv_royalty_variables %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    concept_variable = paste0(
      label, " (omo:", omo_id,")")
    ) %>%
  dplyr::select(concept_variable, description) %>%
  knitr::kable(
    caption = fig_caption,
    booktabs = TRUE,
    escape = FALSE   # allows links
  ) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(
    full_width = FALSE
  )

save_kbl_if_needed(kbl_obj = tv_cisac_vars_tbl,
                   path = fname,
                   figure_dir = save_dir)

render_kbl_or_image(kbl_obj = tv_cisac_vars_tbl,
                    path = fname,
                    figure_dir = save_dir)
```

For analytical stability and cross-border comparability, terrestrial broadcasting, cable retransmission, satellite transmission, and web-based television are treated as a single television category. This avoids artificial fragmentation driven by national regulatory or licensing structures rather than by economic substance.

Where neighbouring rights are included, the authors’ totals are complemented by:

-   gross performing royalty revenue from television use (performers), and
-   gross performing royalty revenue from television use (producers),

again excluding mechanical royalties on the recording side.

#### Discotheques and background music

Public performance outside broadcasting is grouped into two closely related categories. For authors, these uses are covered by:

Live music requires a specific clarification. While [omo:Q2062](https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2062)  and [omo:Q2060](https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2060) have neighboring rights equivalents, live performance royalties ([omo:Q2061](https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2061)) apply only to authors, as reflected in:

However, the total economic value of concerts extends beyond authors’ royalties. Performers’ remuneration, technical crew costs, and live production management are typically financed from ticket revenues and are not fully reflected in CISAC-aligned accounting data. For this reason, concert values are treated asymmetrically: authors’ royalties are included directly, while neighbouring-rights income requires separate estimation if a full value-chain analysis is undertaken.

```{r showscisacconcert, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}

tbl_no <- next_table_number()
fname <- sprintf(
  "fig-%02d-valuation-pilot.png", tbl_no)

                    figure_dir = save_dir)
```

#### Digital and multimedia uses

Digital and multimedia uses are captured for authors through:

```{r cisacdigital, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
digital_royalty_variables <- data.frame(
  label = c(
    "gross mechanical royalty revenue from digital and multimedia uses (authors)",
    "gross performance royalty revenue from digital and multimedia uses (authors)", 
    "gross royalty revenue from digital and multimedia uses"
  ),
  omo_id = c("Q2070", "Q2071", "Q2089"),
  url = c(
    "https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2070",
    "https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2071",
    "https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2089"
  ),
  description = c(
    "total gross revenue from mechanical rights collected for authors for digital and multimedia uses of music, including online reproductions, downloads, ringtones, and other digitally mediated or multimedia forms of reproduction of musical works",
    "total gross revenue from performance rights collected for authors for digital and multimedia uses of music, including online streaming, webcasting, platform-based performances, and other digitally mediated public communication of musical works", 
    "total gross revenue from both performing and reproduction rights collected for authors for digital and multimedia uses of music, including online streaming, webcasting, platform-based performances, and other digitally mediated public communication of musical works")
)

tbl_no <- next_table_number()
fname <- sprintf(
  "fig-%02d-valuation-pilot.png", tbl_no)
fig_caption <-  sprintf(
  "Table %02d. Digital and media royalty revenue  variables (authors)", tbl_no)

digital_cisac_vars_tbl <- digital_royalty_variables %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    concept_variable = paste0(
      label, " (omo:", omo_id,")")
    ) %>%
  dplyr::select(concept_variable, description) %>%
  knitr::kable(
    caption = fig_caption,
    booktabs = TRUE,
    escape = FALSE   # allows links
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    latex_options = c("hold_position", "scale_down"), 
    bootstrap_options = c(
      "striped", 
      "hover", "condensed", 
      "responsive"), 
    full_width = FALSE) 

save_kbl_if_needed(kbl_obj =digital_cisac_vars_tbl,
                   path = fname,
                   figure_dir = save_dir)

render_kbl_or_image(kbl_obj = digital_cisac_vars_tbl,
                    path = fname,
                    figure_dir = save_dir)
```

These two revenue streams are aggregated to represent the total value of online and multimedia exploitation for authors.

```{r showscisacdigital, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
tbl_no <- next_table_number()
fname <- sprintf(
  "fig-%02d-valuation-pilot.png", tbl_no)
fig_caption <-  sprintf(
  "Table %02d. Digital and media revenue data in the synthetic datasets", tbl_no)


digital_rows <- synthetic_revenues %>%
  mutate_all(as.character) %>%
  filter ( grepl("digital", variable_name))

digital_tbl <- digital_rows %>%
  select (-variable_name, -uri) %>%
  kbl(
    caption = "Digital and media revenue data in the synthetic datasets", 
    booktabs = TRUE
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    latex_options = c("hold_position", "scale_down"), 
    bootstrap_options = c(
      "striped", 
      "hover", "condensed", 
      "responsive"), 
    full_width = FALSE) %>%
  add_header_above(
    c(" " = 1,
      "Livonia" = 2,
      "Pomeralia" = 2))


save_kbl_if_needed(kbl_obj = digital_tbl,
                   path = fname,
                   figure_dir = save_dir)

render_kbl_or_image(kbl_obj = digital_tbl,
                    path = fname,
                    figure_dir = save_dir)
```

On the neighbouring-rights side, the aggregation logic may differ by country and licensing model. Some uses generate performer and producer revenues through collective management, while others are handled contractually. The CISAC-aligned framework therefore treats neighbouring-rights digital revenues as an extension layer that must be harmonised carefully to maintain comparability.

#### Phonograms and physical or digital sales

For authors, revenues from sound recordings are captured through gross mechanical royalty revenue from digital and multimedia uses (authors) [omo:Q2065](https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2065). It is defined as the total gross revenue from mechanical rights collected for authors for digital and multimedia uses of music, including online reproductions, downloads, ringtones, and other digitally mediated or multimedia forms of reproduction of musical works.

```{r showscisacphono, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}

tbl_no <- next_table_number()
fname <- sprintf(
  "fig-%02d-valuation-pilot.png", tbl_no)
fig_caption <-  sprintf(
  "Table %02d. Phonogram revenue data in the synthetic datasets", tbl_no)


phono_rows <- synthetic_revenues %>%
  mutate_all(as.character) %>%
  filter ( grepl("phono", variable_name))

phono_tbl  <- phono_rows %>%
  select (-variable_name, -uri) %>%
  kbl(
    caption = fig_caption,
    booktabs = TRUE
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    latex_options = c("hold_position", "scale_down"), 
    bootstrap_options = c(
      "striped", 
      "hover", "condensed", 
      "responsive"), 
    full_width = FALSE) %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1,
                     "Livonia" = 2,
                     "Pomeralia" = 2))


save_kbl_if_needed(kbl_obj = phono_tbl,
                   path = fname,
                   figure_dir = save_dir)

render_kbl_or_image(kbl_obj = phono_tbl,
                    path = fname,
                    figure_dir = save_dir)
```

However, producer and performer revenues from phonograms—whether physical sales or downloads—are not collectively managed in the same way and therefore do not appear in CISAC accounting tables. To approximate the full economic value of phonogram exploitation, authors’ mechanical royalties should be combined with producer and performer revenues derived from direct sales, using external industry or statistical sources where necessary.

#### Total cost of use

Finally, high-level aggregates such as

-   gross royalty revenue from digital and multimedia uses [Q2089](https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2089)
-   gross royalty revenue from radio use (authors) [omo:Q2054](https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2054)
-   gross royalty revenue from television (authors) [omo:Q2057](https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2057)

are used for analytical purposes within the market comparator model.

In this model, these aggregates can be compared directly with observable indicators of radio or television use. From the perspective of the end user (the radio listener or television viewer), or from that of the payer of the royalty (the broadcasting organisation), the legal basis of individual royalty components is irrelevant. What matters is the total cost of lawful use.

```{r showscisactotal, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
tbl_no <- next_table_number()
fname <- sprintf(
  "fig-%02d-valuation-pilot.png", tbl_no)
fig_caption <-  sprintf(
  "Table %02d. Aggregated total use data in the synthetic datasets", tbl_no)

total_rows <- synthetic_revenues %>%
  filter ( grepl("performing", variable_name)) %>%
  filter ( ! grepl("terrestial|cable|subtotal|concert", variable_name))

total_tbl <- total_rows %>%
  select (-label, -uri) %>%
  kbl(
    caption = fig_caption, 
    booktabs = TRUE
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    latex_options = c("hold_position", "scale_down"), 
    bootstrap_options = c(
      "striped", 
      "hover", "condensed", 
      "responsive"), 
    full_width = FALSE) %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1,
                     "Livonia" = 2,
                     "Pomeralia" = 2))

save_kbl_if_needed(kbl_obj = phono_tbl,
                   path = fname,
                   figure_dir = save_dir)

render_kbl_or_image(kbl_obj = phono_tbl,
                    path = fname,
                    figure_dir = save_dir)
```

This reinforces our methodological preference for analysing total revenue streams—combining authors’, performers’, and producers’ revenues—wherever all three rights apply. In such cases, lawful exploitation is not possible without securing all required licences, regardless of how the total payment is divided across legal claims. For end users and licensees alike, it is immaterial whether the paid amount is allocated across two, three, or even five separate rights categories. The internal breakdown of revenues reflects the structure of the licensing system, not the economic reality of use. A familiar analogy can be found in cinema production, where producers typically clear a large number of underlying rights, yet cinemas and audiences encounter only a single licence fee or ticket price. The same logic applies to music: the disaggregation of total value is a matter of rights administration, while the market comparator model is concerned with the total economic value of use.

### IFPI-Aligned Data {#sec-pilot-ifpi-replication}

IFPI-aligned data are used in the pilot study to calibrate the recording-side revenues of the music market and to provide a market-based counterpart to CISAC-aligned authors’ revenues. Public IFPI reports, including global, regional, and national publications, present recorded music revenues by format and distribution channel, such as physical sales, downloads, subscription streaming, ad-supported streaming, performance rights, and synchronisation. These data reflect revenues accruing to producers after platform shares and intermediary costs, and therefore correspond conceptually to net distributable revenues on the CISAC side.

For reconciliation within the market comparator model, the key variables required from IFPI-aligned data *are revenue totals by market segment* and, where available, distinctions between major formats or channels. These variables allow recording-side revenues to be aligned with quantities of use derived from CAP surveys and with aggregated authors’ revenues. As with CISAC-aligned data, stability and comparability of categories across countries are prioritised over fine-grained detail.

Important differences exist between national, regional, and global IFPI reporting structures. Global reports provide harmonised definitions and benchmarks, regional reports such as those for the European Union place market data in a policy and comparative context, and national reports or country annexes offer more detailed insight into local market structures. The replication strategy presented here accommodates all three levels, allowing users to rely on whichever IFPI-aligned sources are publicly available or internally accessible in their national context.

Our IFPI-aligned synthetic data for the fictitious territories of Livonia and Pomeralia:

```{r showifpisynth, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
ifpi_rows <- synthetic_revenues %>%
  filter(grepl("revenue", variable_name)) %>%
  filter(!grepl("terrestial|cable|subtotal|concert", variable_name))

    caption = "IFPI-aligned data in the synthetic datasets",
    booktabs = TRUE
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    latex_options = c("hold_position", "scale_down"), 
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", 
                          "hover", "condensed", 
                          "responsive"), 
    full_width = FALSE)  %>%

  ))

  figure_dir = save_dir
)

render_kbl_or_image(
  kbl_obj = ifpi_tbl,
  path = fname,
  figure_dir = save_dir
)
```

For our reports, it would be ideal to have the ratio of domestic and international sales within the territory. Mahasz in Hungary reports this in the already cited statistical datasets, ČNS IFPI for Slovakia does not. In Hungary, depending on the sales format and the year, the domestic sales rate was betwen 29-49% in 2023-2024. For our synthetic data we will use similar rates.

### Reconciliation Between Rights Groups {#sec-pilot-reconcile-rightsholder-groups}

Reconciling authors’, performers’, and producers’ data is a necessary step when applying the market comparator model to total music value. Each group is represented through different reporting systems and institutional arrangements, and their revenues are not observed within a single, unified accounting framework.

Authors’ revenues are typically reported through CISAC-aligned collective management data, while producers’ and, in part, performers’ revenues are captured through IFPI-aligned market reports or neighbouring rights organisations. The reconciliation task therefore consists of aligning these perspectives at an aggregate level, rather than attempting to replicate contractual or legal distributions in detail.

A central concern in this process is the avoidance of double counting. Certain uses of music generate revenues for multiple rightsholder groups from the same underlying act of consumption, most notably in digital uses such as streaming. In the pilot study, overlaps are handled by clearly separating revenue sources by reporting origin and by aggregating only once at the level of total value. Rights-based categories are first harmonised within their respective domains and then combined using a consistent aggregation logic that ensures each revenue stream enters the model a single time. Where categories overlap conceptually, they are reconciled through documented assumptions rather than through mechanical summation.

Institutional differences across countries are acknowledged but not modelled in detail at this stage. The number of collecting societies, the degree of fragmentation between authors’ and neighbouring rights, and the scope of collectively managed versus individually managed rights all vary by jurisdiction. The reconciliation approach adopted here abstracts from these differences and focuses on the economic function of each revenue stream. This allows the model to remain transferable and comparable across countries, while leaving room for users to introduce country-specific refinements when authorised data and detailed institutional knowledge are available.

### Using a CAP Survey {#sec-pilot-cap}

Cultural access and participation (CAP) surveys are used in the valuation framework to construct consistent quantity measures of music use across market and non-market contexts. The surveys applied in this project build on the ICET model recommended by the ESSNet-Culture statistical working group, which was established by Eurostat together with the national statistical offices of 15 Member States to develop harmonised approaches for measuring cultural and creative industries. The ICET model structures cultural participation into four dimensions—Information; Communication and community; Enjoyment and expression; and Transaction—and explicitly covers both market-based and non-market forms of cultural engagement [@frank_guy_essnet-culture_2012, pp 237–239]. The model has a long tradition in quantitative sociology and media research, with several decades of empirical application [@de_haan_virtuele_2008; @de_haan_nowadays_2012].

The ICET-based CAP surveys were first applied by the former CEEMID project in Hungary, Slovakia, and Croatia with the explicit aim of improving the measurement of music use quantities in contexts where transactional data are incomplete or unavailable. Over multiple survey waves, these survey-based quantity estimates were cross-checked against both public and non-public transactional data sources wherever such data were available. These validation exercises indicated that self-reported listening quantities are subject to recall and reporting error, but provided no evidence of systematic directional bias across countries, use contexts, or survey waves. In aggregation, the observed errors behaved as non-systematic measurement noise rather than as structural distortion. On this basis, and in line with ESSNet-Culture recommendations, no alternative modelling framework was identified that would offer better coverage of both market and non-market music use while remaining feasible within realistic survey length and respondent burden constraints.

Reprex grew out of the CEEMID project as a research and development company and brought this methodological background into the OpenMusE project. Following the Open Policy Analysis guidelines, the methodological description of this background was made available for internal and external stakeholders in 2023.[^pilot-6]

To operationalise the survey-based measurement required for the valuation framework, Reprex organised the full set of survey questions needed for this analysis into a structured *QuestionBank*, which forms part of the Open Music Observatory (OMO). The QuestionBank provides a curated and reusable collection of survey questions defined independently of their specific placement or ordering in any single questionnaire instrument. This design supports reuse across survey waves, countries, and analytical contexts, while preserving clear provenance, version control, and multilingual documentation.

The QuestionBank is implemented within the OMO data model using a Wikibase-based knowledge representation, with explicit mappings to the *DDI-RDF Discovery Vocabulary*[^pilot-7] (the Disco model). In this model, abstract survey questions correspond to `disco:Question` entities, while their concrete uses in questionnaires are represented as question usages equivalent to DDI QuestionConstructs. Multilingual versions of question wording are stored separately from question identity and can be exported losslessly as `disco:questionText`, ensuring full interoperability with DDI-compliant tools and survey documentation systems.

[^pilot-7]: *DDI-RDF Discovery Vocabulary (Disco): A vocabulary for publishing metadata about research and survey data on the Web of Linked Data* [@ddi-rdf_discovery_2025]

This alignment is situated within the broader framework of the *Generic Statistical Information Model* (GSIM)[^pilot-8], developed under the auspices of the *United Nations Economic Commission for Europe* (UNECE).

[^pilot-8]: *Generic Statistical Information Model* [@GSIM_v20_2025]

GSIM provides a technology-neutral reference model for the production of official statistics, defining core information objects such as concepts, variables, classifications, data sets, and statistical processes. Within GSIM, DDI and SDMX function as complementary implementation standards: DDI focuses on the documentation of data collection instruments, microdata, and their metadata, while SDMX provides the standardised structures and semantics for the representation and exchange of aggregated statistical data and data cubes[^pilot-9].

[^pilot-9]: *SDMX 3.0 Technical Specifications. Section 2 Information Model: {UML} Conceptual Design. Version 3.0* [@sdmx_information_model_v3]

By aligning the OMO QuestionBank and questionnaire metadata with DDI-Disco, and by structuring derived indicators and aggregates in a manner consistent with SDMX and the *W3C Data Cube* model, the Open Music Observatory data architecture conforms to the GSIM information model. This alignment allows the CAP surveys used in this project to be fully harmonised with European and national statistical surveys, facilitating integration with official statistics workflows and comparative analysis across countries and time, and the replication of our piloting work presented here.

On this foundation, the CAP questionnaire used in OpenMusE was designed by Reprex as an operational implementation of the ICET framework, informed by experience from approximately ten national CAP surveys conducted over the past decade.[^pilot-10] The questionnaire design explicitly targets the construction of use quantities rather than the inference of prices, preferences, or welfare measures. Questions are formulated to elicit notional listening time, which can subsequently be normalised into annual listening hours and aligned with the quantity definitions used throughout the market comparator framework.

[^pilot-10]: The OPA folder for this work with the source files can be found at [@openmuse_opa_folder_valuation]

The recall strategy reflects an explicit recognition of the cognitive limits of self-reported listening behaviour. Music listening has become increasingly ubiquitous over the past decade as smartphones and mobile internet access have integrated music into commuting, work, and other everyday activities. This ubiquity reduces the salience of listening events and complicates recall. To mitigate this effect, the questionnaire triangulates different recall horizons, asking about listening behaviour using weekly, monthly, and annualised formulations. In addition, listening time is elicited separately for different contexts—at home, while travelling, and at work or study—not as analytically distinct locations, but as memory cues. These contextual prompts help respondents recall different devices and listening modes, such as turntables or physical media at home, radio listening in vehicles during travel, or streaming services used to mask background noise at work.

Survey responses are mapped from listening behaviour to analytical use categories prior to aggregation. Once classified, listening time across locations is aggregated within the same use category and annualised to ensure consistency with other quantity measures in the model. This approach avoids double counting and ensures that CAP-derived quantities are directly comparable with quantities derived from transactional and administrative sources.

The sample frame design follows the same error-minimisation logic. Based on earlier CAP surveys, which showed relatively stable response distributions over time, and on the well-documented decline of cultural participation with age in almost all European countries, the sampling strategy intentionally overrepresents younger cohorts at the data collection stage. Younger respondents account for a disproportionate share of music listening time, and quantity estimates are therefore particularly sensitive to sparse participation among older cohorts. Overrepresentation of younger age groups reduces total measurement error for quantity estimates once post-stratification weighting is applied to restore population representativeness. This design choice is optimal for quantity construction and is consistent with established survey methodology for behaviours that are highly age-dependent.

CAP survey data are thus used exclusively on the quantity side of the valuation framework. They provide harmonised measures of music use across market and non-market contexts, but do not contain information on transaction prices, willingness to pay, or welfare effects. Prices enter the model only through observed market data or through revenue–quantity comparisons that yield implicit prices at an aggregate level. Behavioural survey data are not used to infer prices or welfare measures, and their role is limited to supporting consistent and comprehensive quantity estimation.

## Known Limitations & Assumptions {#sec-pilot-limitations}

The market comparator model applied in this pilot study builds on earlier analytical practices developed by organisations such as Reprex, Artisjus, and SOZA, where similar approaches were used in contexts partly informed by competition law. In those settings, the notion of a “*relevant market*” was employed to operationalise the scope within which prices, quantities, and revenues could be meaningfully observed and compared. This tradition informs the present work, particularly in the way uses and revenue streams are delineated and aggregated.

At the same time, this pilot study does not assume that this is the only possible or universally valid way to operationalise music markets. Nor do we claim that the results of this methodology, as presented here, can be directly used in competition law–based economic analysis without further assumptions, refinements, and legal interpretation. The focus of the pilot is methodological: to show how a market comparator model can be constructed and applied in a transparent and reproducible way given realistic data constraints.

Nevertheless, we maintain that *some well-defined and operationalised concept of the market is a necessary precondition for applying any market comparator model*. A relevant market definition requires at least two dimensions: product or service homogeneity and geographical homogeneity. Without clear boundaries defining what constitutes a unit of use, a revenue stream, or a comparable segment, quantities and revenues cannot be meaningfully aligned.

In music markets, both dimensions raise non-trivial issues. Royalty revenues arising from the use of recorded music and from authors’ shares in live performances *are territorial in nature*. As a result, it is usually reasonable to assume that meaningful comparisons can be constructed at the level of a copyright jurisdiction, which in most cases corresponds to the territory of a national polity.

The *product dimension is more ambiguous*. It requires explicit choices about whether the analysis is limited to licensed uses of music or also includes exceptions such as private copying, and whether measured illegal use is within scope. Further boundary questions arise around the distinction between audiobooks, podcasts, and music sound recordings, which are all technically audio recordings but are subject to different rights regimes and market practices.

The assumptions adopted in this pilot study are therefore explicit and deliberately limited in scope. They are not intended to prescribe a single correct market definition, but to provide a transparent and adaptable framework that can be refined or re-specified when the model is applied in different legal, institutional, or analytical contexts.

### Individually Managed Streaming Revenues {#sec-pilot-individually-managed}

A key limitation of the model concerns the partial observability of streaming revenues that are individually managed, particularly on the publishing side and, in some jurisdictions, on the neighbouring rights side. Public data sources do not provide a complete view of how streaming revenues are allocated across all rightsholders, as significant portions may be licensed directly rather than through collective management organisations.

For this reason, the model operates primarily on collectively managed shares of streaming revenues, as these are the components that can be observed, reported, and reconciled with reasonable confidence. While this implies that total streaming value may be understated in some contexts, the approach remains suitable for comparative analysis as long as the scope of observation is applied consistently across uses and territories.

### Publisher Direct Licensing

Publisher direct licensing further affects the visibility of authors’ revenues, particularly in digital and streaming markets. Where publishers license rights directly to platforms, the resulting revenues do not appear in CISAC-aligned collective management data and are therefore absent from the observed authors’ revenue aggregates.

This limitation does not invalidate the comparative use of the model, provided that it is clearly acknowledged and treated consistently. The market comparator model compares observed revenues to observed or estimated quantities within a defined scope. As long as the scope excludes directly licensed revenues in a systematic way, the inferred prices and comparisons remain meaningful within that scope, even if they do not represent the full economic value of all music uses.

### Producer / Performer Split {#sec-producer-performer-split}

In the Livonian example, a simplified split between producers’ and performers’ neighbouring rights revenues is assumed, for instance on a 50:50 basis. This simplification is introduced to keep the synthetic example tractable and to avoid introducing country-specific contractual detail that would obscure the methodological demonstration.

It is important to stress that this split is a modelling parameter, not a normative or legal assumption. Different countries apply different rules, contractual practices, and institutional arrangements to the allocation of neighbouring rights revenues. Users applying the model to real data are expected to replace this simplified split with authorised and context-specific information where available.

### National and Domestic Revenues

Several of the limitations discussed above are not intrinsic to digital music markets, but rather reflect the aggregation level of currently available public data. In particular, national market reports typically do not distinguish between domestic and foreign streaming revenues, nor do they expose platform- or tier-specific price–quantity relationships. A separate methodological preprint explores how these limitations could be addressed using distributor-level reporting, demonstrating that it is, in principle, possible to disentangle territorial revenues and effective prices under appropriate data-access conditions. We return to the implications of this approach in the concluding @sec-conclusion.

### Country-Specific Institutional Differences {#sec-pilot-institutional-differences}

Rights management structures vary significantly across countries. Differences include the number of collecting societies, the degree of separation or consolidation between authors’ and neighbouring rights, and the balance between collective and individual management. These institutional variations affect how data are produced, reported, and accessed.

In this pilot study, such differences are deliberately abstracted in order to focus on the core logic of the market comparator model. The synthetic Livonian case represents a simplified but plausible institutional configuration, closely resembling that of Hungary, where each institution with its own separate financial reporting clearly represents a class of rights (authors', producers' or performers' rights.) In Slovakia, SLOVGRAM represents both producer's and performer's rights, but SOZA does not represent literary author's rights that Artisjus represents.

In practical applications, local adaptation will be required to map national data sources into the common structure used by the model. The replication strategy outlined earlier is designed to support such adaptations without altering the underlying analytical framework.

## Data Comparisons {#sec-pilot-comparisons}

This section describes how revenues, quantities, and prices are aligned within the market comparator framework. Two complementary comparison strategies are applied:

-   revenue–quantity comparisons used to infer implicit (shadow) prices, and

-   quantity–price comparisons used where observable prices exist.

Both rely on *a common normalisation* of use to annual notional listening hours.

### Conceptual Framework for Comparisons {#sec-pilot-compare-concept}

At the core of the market comparator model is the identity

$$
R_{u} = Q_{u} \times P_{u}
$$
<!-- -->
where $R_{u}$ denotes revenue associated with use category $u$, $Q_{u}$ denotes the quantity of use, and $P_{u}$ denotes the unit price. This identity is not a behavioural model but an accounting relationship that must hold by definition once the three elements are measured or inferred on a consistent basis.

The usefulness of this identity in music markets lies in the fact that, for most uses of music, not all three components are observable at the same level of aggregation or from the same data source. In some cases, detailed price and quantity information exists at the level of individual rightsholders or intermediaries, but is not available in aggregated public data. In other cases, revenues are observed while quantities of use must be inferred or normalised.

In *streaming markets*, unit prices are in principle observable for rightsholders. Royalty statements provided by digital distributors typically contain information on per-unit remuneration, quantities of streams, and differentiation by platform and subscription tier, such as premium, family, student, trial, or ad-supported offers. However, this granular information is not available in publicly accessible, national-level IFPI-aligned market reports. At that level, streaming revenues are reported in aggregated form by market segment, without corresponding quantities or effective prices, which necessitates inference when working with public data sources.

![](png/streaming/streaming_price_regional_comparison_2025Q3_6x4.png){fig-align="center"}

In *public performance*, the observability problem is reversed. For broadcasting uses, such as radio and television, quantities of use are in principle observable and often reported through playlists, cue sheets, or monitoring systems, albeit with varying degrees of completeness and accuracy. For other forms of public performance, particularly background music use in hotels, restaurants, catering establishments, retail spaces, and similar environments, actual use is rarely measured directly. Revenues are typically collected on the basis of tariffs or estimated usage profiles, meaning that quantities of use must be approximated rather than observed.

As a result, *the market comparator model does not assume that prices or quantities are inherently unobservable*, but recognises that they are not jointly observable in a consistent, aggregated form suitable for comparative analysis.

The model therefore treats the identity $R_{u} = Q_{u} \times P_{u}$ as an inferential tool. Depending on the use category and data availability, either prices or quantities are inferred from observed revenues and complementary information, using explicit assumptions and documented proxies.

A key distinction in the model is between observed price $P_{u}$ and *inferred, or shadow, prices* $\hat{P}_{u}$.

**Observed prices** exist where users pay a directly identifiable price per unit, such as subscription fees, download prices, or physical sales prices.

**Shadow prices** arise where no explicit unit price is observable and must be derived implicitly as

$$
\hat{P}_{u} = \frac{R_{u}}{Q_{u}}
$$
<!-- -->
These shadow prices represent average remuneration per unit of use within a defined category and period. They are not tariffs, contractual rates, or marginal prices, but economic indicators that allow relative comparison across uses, markets, or territories.

The scope of comparison in this pilot is the total economic value of music by use category $u$.

Revenues are aggregated across authors’ rights and neighbouring rights to reflect the full value generated by music consumption, irrespective of institutional distribution. Use categories are defined to be economically meaningful and sufficiently stable across countries, such as streaming, broadcasting, public performance, mechanical reproduction, and live performance.

### Revenue–Quantity Comparisons (Implicit Prices) {#sec-pilot-rq-comparisons}

#### Purpose and Interpretation {#sec-pilot-rq-purpose}

When prices are not directly observable, implicit (shadow) prices are inferred by rearranging the market comparator equation:

$$
\hat{P}_{u} = \frac{R_{u}}{Q_{u}}
$$
<!-- -->
This approach allows relative price levels to be compared across uses, markets, or territories, even when no explicit tariff or transaction price exists.

-   When and why shadow prices $\hat{P}_{u}$ are inferred
-   Economic interpretation of implicit prices as average value per unit of use
-   Limits of interpretation (not contractual or normative prices)

#### Revenue Inputs {#sec-pilot-rq-revenue-inputs}

Revenues $R_{u}$ are constructed from multiple reporting systems and aggregated to reflect total music value.

-   CISAC-aligned authors’ revenues
-   IFPI-aligned neighbouring rights revenues
-   Net distributable revenues as the preferred comparison basis
-   Aggregation rules and avoidance of double counting

Formally, for each use category $u$:

$$
R_{u} = R^{A}_{u} + R^{N}_{u}
$$
<!-- -->
where $R^{A}_{u}$ denotes authors’ revenues and $R^{N}_{u}$ denotes neighbouring rights revenues. The specific computations are reported in @sec-pilot-use-treatment.

#### Quantity Inputs {#sec-pilot-rq-quantity-inputs}

Quantities $Q_{u}$ are derived from CAP survey data and expressed as annual notional listening hours.

-   CAP-based listening hours
-   Mapping of CAP variables to use categories
-   Aggregation across locations (home, work, travel)

For a given use category $u$:

$$
Q_{u} = \sum_{l} H_{u,l}
$$
<!-- -->
where $H_{u,l}$ denotes listening hours in location $l$.

#### Matching Revenues to Quantities {#sec-pilot-rq-matching}

-   Definition of comparable use categories $u$
-   Handling of cross-right and mixed-use categories
-   Treatment of residual or estimated uses

The matching process ensures that each $R_{u}$ is paired with a conceptually consistent $Q_{u}$. The following, @sec-pilot-use-treatment, explains in detail the matching process in each use category.

#### Outputs {#sec-pilot-rq-outputs}

-   Implicit price per listening hour $\hat{P}_{u}$
-   Relative price indicators across uses: $\frac{\hat{P}_{u}}{\hat{P}_{v}}$
-   Cross-country comparability considerations

$$\frac{\hat{P}_{u}}{\hat{P}_{v}}$$
<!-- -->

### Quantity–Price Comparisons (Observed Prices) {#sec-pilot-qp-comparisons}

#### Purpose and Role in the Model {#sec-pilot-qp-purpose}

Where prices are directly observable, the model reverses the logic and validates revenue–quantity results.

-   Validation and calibration of shadow prices
-   Complementarity with revenue–quantity comparisons

#### Observable Price Sources {#sec-pilot-observable-price}

Observed prices $P_{u}$ are available for a limited subset of music uses. Where such prices exist, they can be used either directly in quantity–price comparisons or indirectly as calibration and validation points for inferred (shadow) prices derived from revenue–quantity comparisons.

![Subscription prices are the most visible and widely observed prices in contemporary music markets.](png/streaming/streaming_price_dispersion_eu_2025Q3_6x4.png){fig-align="center"}

Subscription prices are the most visible and widely observed prices in contemporary music markets. Retail subscription fees for streaming services are publicly advertised and vary across subscription tiers, such as individual, family, student, and ad-supported plans. While these prices are not prices per unit of music use, they provide meaningful proxies for relative price differences across platforms and user segments. In this pilot study, subscription prices are treated as contextual benchmarks rather than as direct unit prices, and their analytical implications are explored further in Section @sec-conclusion.

Download prices are, in principle, observable at the level of individual transactions. Retail prices for permanent downloads are publicly listed by digital stores and platforms, and, when combined with sales volume data, can be used to derive average prices per unit sold. However, download markets are increasingly fragmented and declining in importance, and publicly available aggregate statistics are often limited. As a result, download prices are treated cautiously and primarily as supplementary calibration points.

Physical sales prices are observable through industry reporting in some countries. In Hungary, Mahasz publishes a long historical series of annual statistics on physical music sales, spanning more than two decades. These data include breakdowns by format and, in some cases, by repertoire categories such as local, international, or classical music. By combining revenues and unit sales, average prices per physical unit can be derived. These prices reflect one-off transactions rather than ongoing use and therefore require stock–flow normalisation when compared to annual listening quantities.

Ticket prices for live performances constitute another category of observed prices. Collective management organisations routinely collect information on average ticket prices for concerts, as these figures are required to calculate authors’ and performers’ remuneration. Similar information is available for discotheques and other forms of foreground public performance, where remuneration is often linked to ticketed or attendance-based events. These prices can be aligned relatively directly with event-based quantities, although they still require aggregation to an annual basis.

Platform-level pricing for streaming, in the sense of effective price per stream or per listening hour, is technically observable at the level of individual rightsholders through distributor reports. Such reports contain detailed information on quantities and revenues by platform, territory, and subscription tier. However, this level of detail is not available in aggregated national IFPI reports or other public data sources. Consequently, in this pilot study, platform-level pricing is approximated by dividing total national streaming revenues by notional listening hours derived from CAP survey data. This approach yields an average implicit price per listening hour at the country level, suitable for comparative analysis but not for platform-specific pricing assessment.

Together, these observable price sources provide partial anchors for the market comparator model. They do not eliminate the need for inferred prices, but they support validation, sensitivity analysis, and interpretation of the results derived from revenue–quantity comparisons.

#### Observable Quantity Sources {#sec-pilot-observable-quantity}

-   Sales volumes
-   Subscription counts
-   Stream counts (where available)
-   Conversion to listening hours

Observed quantities $Q_{u}$ are transformed to notional hours to maintain consistency:

$$
Q_{u} = V_{u} \times \alpha_{u}
$$
<!-- -->
where $V_{u}$ denotes observed volume and $\alpha_{u}$ is a conversion factor to listening hours.

For example, we assume that concerts are on average 90 minutes or 1.5 hours long:

$$
Q_{l} = V_{l} \times 1.5
$$
<!-- -->

#### Price–Quantity Alignment {#sec-pilot-price-quantity-alignment}

Aligning prices and quantities requires careful attention to unit consistency, temporal alignment, and the treatment of bundled or averaged pricing structures. Observed prices rarely correspond directly to the units in which quantities are measured, and both must be normalised to ensure that inferred or observed prices are economically meaningful.

Prices are mapped to quantities at the level of comparable use categories. Subscription prices are aligned with aggregated listening hours associated with streaming use, download prices with listening derived from permanent acquisitions, and ticket prices with event-based listening quantities. Where prices apply to bundles of access or consumption rather than to individual units, quantities are aggregated accordingly before alignment.

Unit consistency is achieved by expressing both prices and quantities in annual terms. Revenues are treated as annual flows recognised within the accounting period, and quantities are converted into annual notional listening hours. This ensures that price estimates reflect an implicit price per hour of use rather than per transaction or per access right.

Temporal alignment is particularly important for stock-based uses such as physical recordings and downloads. While revenues are recognised at the time of sale, consumption may occur over multiple years. As discussed in Section @sec-pilot-key-modelling-decisions, this pilot adopts a flow normalisation approach in which annual listening hours are treated as representative of contemporaneous consumption supported by a mix of current and past purchases. This avoids the need for explicit depreciation or amortisation assumptions while maintaining internal consistency.

Bundled and averaged prices are handled through aggregation. Subscription fees, background music licences, and blanket public performance tariffs apply to bundles of music use rather than to individual tracks or events. In these cases, prices are interpreted as average prices over a bundle of listening activity, and quantities are aggregated to the same level. The resulting price–quantity pairs therefore represent average economic relationships rather than marginal prices.

Through these alignment steps, observable prices and quantities can be combined to derive meaningful price indicators or to validate inferred prices obtained from revenue–quantity comparisons. While the resulting prices should not be interpreted as contractual tariffs, they provide a coherent basis for comparative analysis across uses, markets, and territories.

### Stock–Flow Conversion and Annualisation

All quantities are expressed as annual flows:

$$
Q^{\text{annual}}_{u} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} q_{u,t}
$$
<!-- -->

-   Flow normalisation to annual listening hours
-   Treatment of legacy consumption

### Use-Specific Treatment {#sec-pilot-use-treatment}

#### Radio {#sec-pilot-use-radio}

We measured the listening (enjoyment) time of recorded music using a **model survey question** entitled **“Listening duration to recorded music by source and place (last working day)”** ([omo:Q2044](https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2044)). This item is classified in the Open Music Observatory (OMO) knowledge base as a member of the `survey question` class, which is defined as an exact semantic equivalent of `disco:Question` in the DDI-RDF Discovery Vocabulary.

The model survey question represents the abstract definition of the question, independent of any specific questionnaire, ordering, or survey instrument. Multilingual versions of the question wording were recorded using the `title` property, qualified by language tags. These title statements correspond directly to `disco:questionText`, enabling lossless export to DDI-Disco–compliant tools.

The model question was then *contextualised through a set of question usage items*, corresponding to *DDI QuestionConstructs*, which represent the concrete use of the question in specific analytical contexts. These QuestionConstruct items bind the abstract model question to particular combinations of listening source and listening place, and to their placement within a questionnaire instrument.

For the measurement of listening time in broadcast media, the model question was instantiated for the sources **radio** and **television**, and for the listening contexts **at home**, **while travelling**, and **at work**. In these instantiations, the same underlying question wording and measurement concept were reused, while the contextual parameters (source and place) were fixed through structured properties rather than through textual variation.

$$
R_{r} = R^{A}_{r} + R^{N}_{r}
$$ If we do not have directly neighboring rights radio revenues, then we use the simplified formula for the total radio use revenue as

$$
R^{T}_{r} = R^{A}_{r}  \times \beta_{perf}
$$ 
<!-- -->
where $\beta_{perf}$ is the multiplier for increasing the revenue with comparable neighboring rights data.
<!-- -->
$$
\hat{P}_{r} = \frac{R^{T}_{r}}{Q_{r}}
$$
<!-- -->

#### Television {#sec-pilot-use-tv}

$$
Q_{r} = Q^{home}_{r} + Q^{travel}_{r} + Q^{work}_{r}
$$
<!-- -->
For reasons of analytical clarity and feasibility, no distinction was made between different broadcast transmission technologies.

In particular, *satellite broadcasting, cable retransmission, and terrestrial broadcasting of radio or television* were treated as a *single radio* and *single television* category. This simplification was adopted to ensure consistency across datasets and to align with the level of detail available in the underlying survey data.
<!-- -->
$$
R^{A}_{tv} = R^{terr}_{tv} + R^{cable}_{tv} +  R^{sat}_{tv} + R^{net}_{tv}
$$
<!-- -->
And the total television revenue is:
<!-- -->
$$
R^{T}_{tv} = R^{A}_{tv}  \times \beta_{perf}
$$
<!-- -->
where $\beta_{perf}$ is the multiplier for increasing the revenue with comparable neighboring rights data.

This modelling approach allows a clear separation between question definition and question usage, supports multilingual documentation, and ensures full interoperability with DDI-Disco, while remaining compatible with the OMO Wikibase data model and downstream statistical processing workflows.
<!-- -->
$$
\hat{P}_{tv} = \frac{R^{T}_{tv}}{Q_{tv}}
$$
<!-- -->
#### Physical and digital records {#sec-pilot-use-mechanical}

In IFPI-aligned data, we find downloads and physical sales separately; in CISAC-aligned data, we find phonograph-related revenues in a separate line. As we explained in @sec-pilot-stock-flow, these royalties are lump-sum, one time royalties. For business buyers, for example, radios or libraries, they are expensed in the year of the purchase. Private buyers may use their physical products for a long time, and for simplicity, we assume that they keep renewing their home collection every year. With this assumption we can compare the CAP year use with the same year's phonogram uses.
<!-- -->
$$
R^{T}_{ph} = R^{A}_{ph}  + R^{N}_{physical} + R^{N}_{download}
$$
<!-- -->

#### Streaming {#sec-pilot-use-streaming}

Some IFPI members report separately ad-supported and premium (subscription) revenue from streaming. We do not have this separation in the CISAC-aligned data, therefore we add all streaming revenue data in the CAP surveys for quantities, and in the revenue data tables together into streaming aggregates.
<!-- -->
$$
Q_{s} = Q^{premium}_{s} + Q^{ad}_{s}
$$
<!-- -->
The other difference is that both CISAC-aligned data and IFPI-aligned data has special multimedia or digital uses, for example, "ringtones", which are less and less used. In CISAC aligned data, they tend to be grouped with streaming, the major "digital" income; in IFPI-aligned data it may appear in "other". In the actual datasets we reviewed these elements were immaterial, so we can claim that in CISAC-aligned data streaming revenues are the bulk of the "digital and multimedia" revenues, even if they are not available as a separate line. In IFPI-aligned data, we find this information under the "streaming category".
<!-- -->
$$
R^{T}_{s} = R^{A}_{s}  + R^{N}_{s} 
$$ The implicit price of streaming per hours:
<!-- -->
$$
\hat{P}_{s} = \frac{R^{T}_{s}}{Q_{s}}
$$
<!-- -->

#### Public Performance {#sec-pilot-use-public-performance}

In IFPI-aligned public data, public performance revenues are reported as a *single aggregate*, without a breakdown by specific use categories such as radio, television, background music, or discotheques. This reflects the market-facing perspective of IFPI reporting, in which public performance is treated as a unified revenue stream rather than as a rights- or use-specific accounting structure. While neighboring rights societies may be able to produce the similar revenue breakup to the CISAC-aligned data, in this case we just use the same proportions that is available for the author's revenues.

CISAC-aligned authors’ data provide a detailed breakdown of public performance revenues by use category. Rather than attempting to infer missing neighbouring-rights revenues through fixed multipliers or country-specific ratios, the pilot adopts a *proportional allocation approach* based on observed authors’ revenue structures.

The procedure consists of three steps: 

1. Calculating the weights.\
2. Looking up the available disaggregated IFPI-aligned data\
3. Breaking up the IFPI-aligned data with the CISAC-aligned weights.\


Let $R^{A}_{u,c,y}$ denote authors’ revenues from public performance use category $u$ (radio, television, digital, background music, discotheques) in country $c$ and year $y$, excluding concerts. For each country–year, we compute the *within-public-performance revenue share* of each use category as:

<!-- -->
$$
w_{u,c,y}
= \frac{R^{A}_{u,c,y}}
       {\sum_{v \in U} R^{A}_{v,c,y}}
$$
<!-- -->

where $U = \{\text{radio}, \text{television}, \text{digital}, \text{background}, \text{discotheques}\}$.
<!-- -->

These shares (weights) sum to one for each country–year:

$$
\sum_{u \in U} w_{u,c,y} = 1
$$

They capture the *relative importance of each use category* within authors’ public performance revenues.

Let $R^{N}_{c,y}$ denote total IFPI-aligned neighbouring-rights public performance revenue for country $c$ and year $y$. This value is observed only at the aggregate level and has no internal use-category breakdown.

Neighbouring-rights public performance revenue is then allocated across use categories using the authors’ revenue shares as weights:

<!-- -->
$$
\tilde{R}^{N}_{u,c,y}
= w_{u,c,y} \times R^{N}_{c,y}
$$
<!-- -->

where $\tilde{R}^{N}_{u,c,y}$ denotes the allocated neighbouring-rights revenue for use category $u$.

This procedure ensures that total IFPI public performance revenue is preserved:
<!-- -->
  
  $$
  \sum_{u \in U} \tilde{R}^{N}_{u,c,y} = R^{N}_{c,y}
  $$
<!-- -->
This way neighbouring-rights revenues inherit a **structurally realistic distribution** across uses,
and no country-specific contractual ratios are assumed.

Concerts are excluded from this allocation. Performers’ remuneration for live performances is typically paid directly by organisers and does not flow through IFPI-aligned public performance reporting in a manner comparable to broadcasting or background music uses. Only authors’ royalties from concerts are therefore retained in the public performance structure, and neighbouring-rights revenues are not allocated to this category.

This weighting approach treats authors’ public performance revenue structures as an *empirical proxy for the distribution of use intensity* across public performance categories. It avoids strong institutional assumptions, remains transparent and reproducible, and can be replaced by country-specific neighbouring-rights breakdowns if authorised data become available.

#### Live Performances {#sec-pilot-use-live}

Concerts are remunerated in two ways: the performers are directly paid, and the composer's share is collected by authors' societies. For the value of concert listening hours, we add the average ticket price for every 90 minutes of the event number.

$$
Q_{l} = V^{event}_{l} \times  1.5
$$

<!-- -->
$$
R_{l} = V^{event}_{l} \times  P^{ticket} + R^{A}_{l}
$$

<!-- -->
$$
\hat{P}_{l} = \frac{R^{T}_{l}}{ V^{event}_{l} \times  1.5}
$$
<!-- -->

#### Discotheques and background music

In the CISAC-aligned data, the public performance fees related to these events are separately reported. In the IFPI-aligned data, in the public releases this information is not available, but internally it may be present. Furthermore, discotheques often ticket for entry.

$$
R_{d} = V^{event}_{d} \times  P^{ticket}_{d} + R^{A}_{d} \times \beta_{perf}
$$

$$
R_{b} = R^{A}_{b} \times \beta_{perf}
$$ $$
\hat{P}_{d} = \frac{R^{T}_{d}}{ V^{event}_{d} \times  1.5}
$$ 
<!-- -->

$$
\hat{P}_{b} = \frac{R^{T}_{b}}{ V^{event}_{b} \times  1.5}
$$

## Conclusion and Further Work {#sec-conclusion}

This pilot study demonstrates how a market comparator model can be implemented using standardised, publicly available, and institutionally familiar data sources, while remaining transparent about assumptions and limitations. In doing so, it deliberately operates at a level of aggregation that reflects what is normally observable to researchers, regulators, and stakeholders. One consequence of this choice is that certain dimensions of digital music markets—most notably the territorial allocation of streaming revenues and the detailed mapping between prices and quantities—remain only partially observable within the model.

Recent methodological work documented in *Microphone Check: What Platform-Level Data Could Change in Music Market Analysis* illustrates that these constraints are not purely technical [@antal_microphone_check_2025]. Using a fictitious sound recording and simulated distributor-level reporting, the study shows how platform-specific prices, subscription tiers, and territorial revenue flows can be reconstructed when more granular data are available. This approach makes it possible to separate domestic and foreign revenues, to identify effective unit prices, and to align consumption volumes more precisely with remuneration outcomes. While such analyses are not currently replicable using public market reports, they point to a feasible direction for future transparency, regulatory cooperation, and evidence-based policy design. Together with the present pilot, this work suggests a layered research agenda: robust comparative analysis using standard data today, and progressively richer market insights as data accessibility improves.
