## Context & Objective {#sec-pilot-context}

This pilot study is developed in the context of a complex and, in several respects, problematic research project, where planned data deliveries and formal analytical components were not provided by research partners as originally foreseen. As a result, the pilot serves both as a methodological demonstration and as a defensible reconstruction of what can be achieved with limited, fragmented, or incomplete inputs. The emphasis is therefore placed on transparency of assumptions, reproducibility of methods, and robustness of the analytical framework, rather than on the completeness or authority of any single dataset.

The analytical framework used in the pilot is the market comparator model. This model relates observed or estimated quantities of use to observed revenues in order to infer implicit or shadow prices, allowing comparisons across uses, markets, or territories. In music markets, where prices are often unobservable or embedded in bundled and zero-price business models, the market comparator model provides a coherent way to compare value across heterogeneous forms of consumption.

The immediate objective of the pilot study is to demonstrate the application of this model using a fully specified but synthetic dataset. Rather than relying on sensitive or proprietary data, the study constructs a complete set of revenue and quantity tables for a hypothetical country, Livonia. This allows the full analytical workflow to be shown end to end, including data reconciliation, aggregation, and interpretation, without exposing confidential information or creating incentives for reverse engineering.

A central design goal is transferability. The model, data structures, and computational workflows are intended to be reusable in any EU Member State, subject only to limited local reconciliation reflecting national institutional arrangements. The pilot therefore prioritises stable, internationally comparable categories and avoids country-specific refinements unless they are essential for conceptual coherence.

Throughout the pilot, the focus remains on the method and the model rather than on publishing results about any real country, organisation, or market. The synthetic example is used to demonstrate how authorised users, with access to their own national data, can apply the same approach to generate meaningful comparative insights within their own legal and institutional constraints.

### Livonia {#sec-pilot-livonia-case}

Livonia is introduced as a fictional territory used exclusively for the purpose of this pilot study. The name is derived from the historical Duchy of Livonia, a former region in the eastern Baltic area, but the contemporary territory described in this study has no real-world political, economic, or institutional counterpart. The choice of Livonia allows the construction of a realistic but non-identifiable example that avoids any implicit reference to existing countries or collecting societies.

The use of a fictional territory is deliberate. It enables the creation of fully synthetic datasets that resemble real-world reporting structures while ensuring that no sensitive data can be inferred or attributed. All revenue figures, quantities, and internal distributions associated with Livonia are artificial, even where they are calibrated to resemble plausible European patterns.

Within the broader Open Music Europe project, and in particular in the Open Music Observatory and Work Package 2, the term “Livonian Music Database” is used for a database of authentic folk music, music compositions, their recordings and textual or music notation (sheet music) manifestations, and their related statistical data in connection with the the Livonians or Livs, an autochthonous ethnolinguistic group historically associated with the broader Livonian region. It also emphasises our methodological drive to create statistical indicators beyond the often too broad national level, for sub-national regions or for genres, or other market niches.

The fictional Livonia used here is not associated with the Livs, their culture, or their historical territory, and the name is employed solely as a neutral and non-identifying label for a synthetic case study.


## Data Sources

### Authors’ Revenues {#sec-pilot-authors-revenues}

Authors’ revenues in this pilot study are represented using CISAC-style royalty tables, which provide a highly standardised view of how authors’ rights are collected and accounted for across Europe. These tables are organised by rights category and mode of use, such as public performance, broadcasting, digital uses, and private copying, and they distinguish between gross collections, deductions, and distributable income. The emphasis of the model is on this reporting structure rather than on the absolute levels of revenue, as the structure is what enables comparability across countries.

Artisjus in Hungary and SOZA in Slovakia are used as structural references because their published reports follow the CISAC reporting conventions closely and illustrate the range of categories that typically appear in authors’ royalty accounting. They serve as practical examples of how CISAC-aligned data are organised, not as sources of values to be reproduced. In the pilot study, their structures inform the design of the Livonian authors’ revenue table, while the numerical values are altered and synthesised to prevent any inference about the real revenues or internal distributions of these organisations.

Accordingly, the analysis focuses on how revenues are grouped, aggregated, and reconciled within the CISAC framework, rather than on the specific financial outcomes of any collecting society. This allows the market comparator model to be applied in a way that is transferable across countries, while respecting the confidentiality and sensitivity of real-world authors’ royalty data.

### Neighbouring Rights Revenues {#sec-pilot-neighbouring-revenues}

Neighbouring rights revenues in this pilot study are described using IFPI-style market reports, which present the recording-side view of the music economy. These reports focus on revenues accruing to producers and, indirectly, performers from recorded music, typically broken down by format such as physical sales, downloads, subscription streaming, ad-supported streaming, performance rights, and synchronisation. Unlike CISAC-aligned tables, which are organised around uses and rights categories, IFPI reporting is market-facing and format-driven, reflecting how recorded music is consumed and monetised.

The *Global Music Report 2025: State of the Industry* provides a comprehensive global overview of recorded music revenues, trends, and market structures from the perspective of producers and the recording industry. It presents harmonised revenue figures across countries and regions, broken down by major formats such as physical sales, downloads, paid and ad-supported streaming, performance rights, and synchronisation, and highlights long-term structural shifts in consumption and monetisation. While the report focuses on aggregate market outcomes rather than rights-specific accounting, it establishes the global benchmarks, definitions, and classification logic that underpin IFPI-aligned national reports. In this pilot study, the *Global Music Report* serves as a conceptual and structural reference for how neighbouring rights revenues are categorised and compared internationally, rather than as a direct source of values to be reproduced [@ifpi_state_of_industry_2025]. Industry stakeholders typically have access to the full *Global Music Report*, which contains market data for all IFPI national jurisdictions (“territories”).

*Music in the EU 2025: A Growth Engine* provides a European-level perspective on the recorded music sector, situating IFPI-style market data within the broader economic, cultural, and policy context of the European Union. The report complements the global view of the *Global Music Report* by focusing on the role of recorded music in the EU economy, including market size, growth dynamics, employment effects, and the contribution of music to the digital single market. While it draws on the same underlying IFPI-aligned revenue classifications, its emphasis is on regional aggregation, policy relevance, and comparative performance across EU Member States [@ifpi_eu_music_report_2025]. In this pilot study, the report is used to contextualise neighbouring rights revenues within the EU framework and to support the plausibility and scalability of the synthetic Livonian data as representative of an EU-style recorded music market.

The Hungarian and Slovak contexts are used as calibration references rather than as sources of values to be replicated.

In Hungary, Mahasz publishes an extensive historical series of recorded music market data aligned with the figures reported to IFPI for the *Global Music Report*, and has made these data publicly available in spreadsheet form since 2003, albeit with some structural changes over time. This long time series illustrates how IFPI-aligned reporting can be implemented consistently at national level and reused for analytical and modelling purposes.

In Slovakia, the *Výsledky trhu 2024: Slovensko* \[Market Results 2024: Slovakia\] provides country-level recorded music market data published by the national IFPI affiliate, following the same classification logic as the IFPI *Global Music Report*. Unlike global or regional summaries, this document offers direct insight into the structure and scale of the Slovak recorded music market, typically presenting revenues by major format such as physical, digital, and streaming. As a publicly available national annex, it demonstrates how IFPI-aligned data can be accessed at country level even when the full *Global Music Report* is not available. In this pilot study, the Slovak report functions as an elementary data source that illustrates how national market figures can be used to calibrate and validate the structure of synthetic neighbouring rights revenue tables without relying on confidential or proprietary datasets.

For the purposes of the Livonian example, the emphasis is on the recording-side perspective and its compatibility with the market comparator model. IFPI-style data provide observed revenues by market segment and format, which can be aligned with measured or estimated quantities of use. The pilot study therefore applies IFPI reporting logic to construct synthetic neighbouring rights revenue tables for Livonia, ensuring that they are consistent with publicly observable market structures while remaining sufficiently abstracted to avoid disclosure of sensitive or proprietary information.


### Quantities {#sec-pilot-quantities}

Quantities in the market comparator model are derived from Cultural Access and Participation (CAP) survey data, which are used to approximate how music is actually consumed across different contexts and channels. CAP surveys are designed to capture participation in cultural activities, including listening to music via radio, television, streaming platforms, and user-uploaded content services, as well as listening at home, at work, or while travelling. In the absence of directly observable transaction-based quantities for many music uses, these surveys provide a structured and widely accepted source of information on patterns of consumption.

In this pilot study, quantities are operationalised as nominal listening hours, which serve as proxies for use intensity. These measures are not unbiased estimates of absolute consumption levels: they are affected by recall bias, survey design, and the limits of self-reported behaviour. However, for the purposes of the market comparator model, absolute precision is not required. The model relies on relative proportions of use across channels and contexts, and there is no strong reason to believe that these proportions are systematically biased across uses within the same survey framework. As a result, nominal listening hours provide a suitable basis for allocating quantities when comparing revenues and inferring implicit or shadow prices.

The CAP surveys used in the Open Music Europe project follow the methodological principles established by ESSNet-Culture, in particular the ICET model, which is recognised as best practice for measuring cultural participation in Europe. This ensures conceptual alignment with official statistics and comparability with other national and European cultural participation surveys. The questionnaires, variables, and harmonisation principles are documented in the Open Music Europe *Data Management Plan* and related methodological deliverables.

Within the project, two CAP surveys were carried out and were intended to be processed through the Open Music Europe statistical software system ecosystem. For the purposes of this pilot study, however, only the raw contractor files were available, and the data are used solely for illustrative purposes. The CAP variables are therefore employed to generate synthetic Livonian quantities that mirror realistic listening patterns, without disclosing or reproducing any sensitive or project-internal data.

### Synthetic Data {#sec-pilot-synthetic-data}

Synthetic data are used throughout this pilot study to address confidentiality, non-disclosure obligations, and ethical constraints associated with the use of real-world royalty and market data. The underlying sources referenced in this work include internal financial reports of collective management organisations, contractor-delivered survey data, and commercially sensitive market information. None of these data can be published, redistributed, or reverse engineered in a public research output. The use of synthetic data therefore allows the analytical method to be demonstrated transparently without exposing protected information or breaching contractual or legal constraints.

The synthetic datasets used for the Livonian example are generated through randomised and non-reversible transformations applied to structurally realistic input data. These transformations preserve orders of magnitude, relative proportions, and internal accounting relationships, while deliberately breaking any stable numerical linkage to the original sources. Random multipliers, asymmetric perturbations, and selective aggregation are applied in ways that make it impossible to infer original revenues, market shares, or internal distributions of any real organisation or country.

Crucially, the purpose of the synthetic data is not to approximate actual values, but to preserve the structural logic required by the market comparator model. The synthetic tables reproduce the same categories, hierarchies, and reconciliation constraints that appear in CISAC- and IFPI-aligned reporting, and they align with realistic patterns of music consumption derived from CAP survey data. This ensures that the model can be fully specified, tested, and communicated, while making clear that meaningful results can only be obtained by users who apply the method to their own authorised data.


## Key Modelling Decisions

### Total Music Value vs Rightsholder-Specific Value

A central modelling decision in this pilot study is to focus on the total value of music, rather than on rightsholder-specific values for authors, performers, or producers. The primary objective of the market comparator model is to relate observed or estimated quantities of use to observed revenues in order to infer implicit prices. From this perspective, the economically relevant object is the total value generated by music consumption, irrespective of how that value is subsequently distributed among different categories of rightsholders.

There is no *a priori* correct or universal split of music value between authors, performers, and producers. The division of revenues reflects legal frameworks, collective bargaining outcomes, contractual practices, and historical institutional arrangements, all of which vary across countries and over time. Even within the European Union, where copyright law is partially harmonised, neighbouring rights and collective management practices differ substantially between jurisdictions. Treating any particular split as normative would therefore introduce assumptions that are external to the market comparator model and not supported by observable market behaviour.

Focusing on total music value has important implications for data aggregation. Revenues from different rights categories and collecting entities must be aggregated across authors’ rights and neighbouring rights, and quantities of use must be defined in a way that is consistent across these domains. Prices are then interpreted as average or shadow prices per unit of use, rather than as contractually specified tariffs for individual rights. This approach allows the model to remain agnostic about institutional detail while still producing meaningful comparative results, and it makes the framework more robust and transferable across countries with different rights management structures.


### Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Conventions {#sec-pilot-segment-conventions}

A key modelling challenge arises from the fact that authors’ rights and neighbouring rights are reported using different conceptual and accounting frameworks. CISAC-aligned data are organised around legal rights and modes of use, such as public performance, broadcasting, mechanical reproduction, and private copying. This rights-based logic reflects how collective management organisations account for and distribute royalties to authors and publishers. In contrast, IFPI-aligned data adopt a market-based perspective, structuring revenues by product format and channel, such as physical sales, downloads, subscription streaming, ad-supported streaming, performance rights, and synchronisation. These two reporting logics are internally consistent but not directly comparable without further reconciliation.

The category commonly labelled as “Digital & Multimedia” illustrates this mismatch particularly clearly. In CISAC-style tables, Digital & Multimedia may appear under both performing rights and mechanical reproduction rights, reflecting the coexistence of communication-to-the-public and reproduction components in digital uses. In IFPI-style reporting, the same underlying consumer behaviour is captured through market segments such as downloads or streaming, without explicit reference to the underlying legal rights. As a result, Digital & Multimedia functions as a cross-right category in rights-based accounting, while appearing as a unified market segment in recording-industry data.

To apply the market comparator model, these differences must be reconciled conceptually. This does not require a perfect one-to-one mapping between CISAC and IFPI categories, but it does require a consistent aggregation logic that aligns revenues and quantities at a comparable level. In this pilot study, reconciliation is achieved by abstracting from legal distinctions where necessary and focusing on economically meaningful units of use. Rights-based categories are aggregated to match market-based segments, or vice versa, using documented assumptions and, where available, external calibration sources. This approach allows the model to bridge institutional reporting differences while remaining transparent about the assumptions involved.

### The Problem of Streaming {#sec-pilot-streaming-problem}

Streaming poses a particular challenge for the market comparator model because the revenues it generates cannot be cleanly split across rights categories without introducing additional assumptions. From the perspective of consumer behaviour, streaming is experienced as a single, integrated mode of access to music. From a legal and accounting perspective, however, the same act of streaming simultaneously involves multiple rights, most notably authors’ performing rights, authors’ mechanical rights, and neighbouring rights for producers and performers. The way in which the total value of streaming is divided among these rights is not directly observable in public data and depends on contractual arrangements, collective management practices, and national legal frameworks.

This highlights a fundamental distinction between consumer-facing measures and rights-based accounting. CAP survey data, platform usage statistics, and market reports capture how listeners engage with streaming services, but they do not reveal how streaming revenues are allocated internally among different rightsholders. CISAC-aligned reports reflect the outcome of this allocation for authors’ rights, but they do so only after internal distributions have taken place and without exposing the underlying splits between different components of digital use. As a result, CISAC public reports do not provide sufficient detail to reconstruct the full streaming value chain, and such information can only be obtained through internal analysis by a CISAC member organisation.

By contrast, IFPI-aligned data provide a clearer public picture of streaming on the recording side. In Hungary and Slovakia, where public IFPI-aligned reports are available, streaming revenues are typically reported as a distinct market segment, often further divided into subscription-based and ad-supported streaming. These figures reflect the total recording-side revenues generated by streaming services in the national market and are directly comparable across countries. However, they do not distinguish between the various authors’ rights components that coexist within the same streaming transactions.

In this pilot study, the gap between consumer behaviour, market-level reporting, and rights-based accounting is addressed through the use of proxies and external calibration. IFPI streaming revenue shares are used to anchor the recording-side value of streaming, while CAP-based listening proportions provide information on relative usage patterns. Where necessary, informed assumptions are introduced to reconcile these sources at an aggregate level, with the explicit understanding that such assumptions can be replaced by more precise country-specific data if and when authorised internal information from collective management organisations becomes available.

## Replication Strategy {#sec-pilot-replication-strategy}

The pilot study is accompanied by a set of spreadsheets that closely resemble the type of data a national consortium, collecting society, or sectoral organisation would typically have access to. These spreadsheets mirror the structure of CISAC- and IFPI-aligned reporting tables and the derived quantity tables used in the market comparator model. They are designed to function as templates rather than as sources of real data. We recommend that, in practical implementations, such data be placed within a secure data-sharing environment governed by appropriate access controls. Within the Open Music Europe framework, both the Slovak and Hungarian federated modules foresee such data spaces in their data models and are designed to exchange harmonised tabular data, even when the underlying values cannot be publicly disclosed.

The replication strategy therefore separates method from data access. The published materials demonstrate how the model operates, how different data sources are reconciled, and how outputs are produced, while allowing national or sectoral users to substitute the synthetic Livonian inputs with their own authorised datasets. This approach ensures that the computational workflow can be reused without modification, while respecting confidentiality constraints and legal obligations associated with real-world data.

### CISAC-Aligned Data {#sec-pilot-cisac-replication}

CISAC-aligned data can be retrieved internally from accounting systems that follow CISAC reporting conventions. With a series of assumptions and estimates, such data can also be partially reconstructed from CISAC members’ published annual financial reports, in particular from profit and loss statements. However, in our experience, reconstructions based solely on public financial reports are necessarily crude and insufficient for detailed analysis. The essential requirement for replicating the market comparator model is therefore not access to published summaries, but the ability to organise authors’ revenue data according to standard CISAC categories, such as type of right, mode of use, and high-level revenue aggregates.

For replication of the model, a limited and clearly defined set of variables is required. At minimum, these include identifiers for rights categories and uses, gross collected revenues, and, where available, net distributable amounts. In practice, net distributable revenues provide the most appropriate comparison point, as they represent the economic value available to rightsholders after collection and administrative deductions. Data should be aggregated at a level that is stable across countries, avoiding overly granular distinctions that reflect national legal or organisational particularities. For comparative purposes, consistency of categories and aggregation levels across countries is more important than completeness of detail.

The synthetic Livonian datasets published alongside this pilot study are structured to closely resemble the expected CISAC-aligned input tables. They demonstrate the required hierarchy, naming conventions, and aggregation logic without exposing sensitive values. Users who are able to map their own CISAC-aligned data into this tabular format can directly reuse the provided computational notebooks and workflows, replacing the synthetic inputs with their own authorised data without further modification of the model.

### IFPI-Aligned Data {#sec-pilot-ifpi-replication}

IFPI-aligned data are used in the pilot study to calibrate the recording-side revenues of the music market and to provide a market-based counterpart to CISAC-aligned authors’ revenues. Public IFPI reports, including global, regional, and national publications, present recorded music revenues by format and distribution channel, such as physical sales, downloads, subscription streaming, ad-supported streaming, performance rights, and synchronisation. These data reflect revenues accruing to producers after platform shares and intermediary costs, and therefore correspond conceptually to net distributable revenues on the CISAC side.

For reconciliation within the market comparator model, the key variables required from IFPI-aligned data are revenue totals by market segment and, where available, distinctions between major formats or channels. These variables allow recording-side revenues to be aligned with quantities of use derived from CAP surveys and with aggregated authors’ revenues. As with CISAC-aligned data, stability and comparability of categories across countries are prioritised over fine-grained detail.

Important differences exist between national, regional, and global IFPI reporting structures. Global reports provide harmonised definitions and benchmarks, regional reports such as those for the European Union place market data in a policy and comparative context, and national reports or country annexes offer more detailed insight into local market structures. The replication strategy presented here accommodates all three levels, allowing users to rely on whichever IFPI-aligned sources are publicly available or internally accessible in their national context.

### Reconciliation Between Rights Groups {#sec-pilot-reconcile-rightsholder-groups}

Reconciling authors’, performers’, and producers’ data is a necessary step when applying the market comparator model to total music value. Each group is represented through different reporting systems and institutional arrangements, and their revenues are not observed within a single, unified accounting framework. Authors’ revenues are typically reported through CISAC-aligned collective management data, while producers’ and, in part, performers’ revenues are captured through IFPI-aligned market reports or neighbouring rights organisations. The reconciliation task therefore consists of aligning these perspectives at an aggregate level, rather than attempting to replicate contractual or legal distributions in detail.

A central concern in this process is the avoidance of double counting. Certain uses of music generate revenues for multiple rightsholder groups from the same underlying act of consumption, most notably in digital uses such as streaming. In the pilot study, overlaps are handled by clearly separating revenue sources by reporting origin and by aggregating only once at the level of total value. Rights-based categories are first harmonised within their respective domains and then combined using a consistent aggregation logic that ensures each revenue stream enters the model a single time. Where categories overlap conceptually, they are reconciled through documented assumptions rather than through mechanical summation.

Institutional differences across countries are acknowledged but not modelled in detail at this stage. The number of collecting societies, the degree of fragmentation between authors’ and neighbouring rights, and the scope of collectively managed versus individually managed rights all vary by jurisdiction. The reconciliation approach adopted here abstracts from these differences and focuses on the economic function of each revenue stream. This allows the model to remain transferable and comparable across countries, while leaving room for users to introduce country-specific refinements when authorised data and detailed institutional knowledge are available.

## Known Limitations & Assumptions {#sec-pilot-limitations}

The market comparator model applied in this pilot study builds on earlier analytical practices developed by organisations such as Reprex, Artisjus, and SOZA, where similar approaches were used in contexts partly informed by competition law. In those settings, the notion of a “relevant market” was employed to operationalise the scope within which prices, quantities, and revenues could be meaningfully observed and compared. This tradition informs the present work, particularly in the way uses and revenue streams are delineated and aggregated.

At the same time, this pilot study does not assume that this is the only possible or universally valid way to operationalise music markets. Nor do we claim that the results of this methodology, as presented here, can be directly used in competition law–based economic analysis without further assumptions, refinements, and legal interpretation. The focus of the pilot is methodological: to show how a market comparator model can be constructed and applied in a transparent and reproducible way given realistic data constraints.

Nevertheless, we maintain that some well-defined and operationalised concept of the market is a necessary precondition for applying any market comparator model. A relevant market definition requires at least two dimensions: product or service homogeneity and geographical homogeneity. Without clear boundaries defining what constitutes a unit of use, a revenue stream, or a comparable segment, quantities and revenues cannot be meaningfully aligned.

In music markets, both dimensions raise non-trivial issues. Royalty revenues arising from the use of recorded music and from authors’ shares in live performances are territorial in nature. As a result, it is usually reasonable to assume that meaningful comparisons can be constructed at the level of a copyright jurisdiction, which in most cases corresponds to the territory of a national polity. The product dimension is more ambiguous. It requires explicit choices about whether the analysis is limited to licensed uses of music or also includes exceptions such as private copying, and whether measured illegal use is within scope. Further boundary questions arise around the distinction between audiobooks, podcasts, and music sound recordings, which are all technically audio recordings but are subject to different rights regimes and market practices.

The assumptions adopted in this pilot study are therefore explicit and deliberately limited in scope. They are not intended to prescribe a single correct market definition, but to provide a transparent and adaptable framework that can be refined or re-specified when the model is applied in different legal, institutional, or analytical contexts.

### Individually Managed Streaming Revenues {#sec-pilot-individually-managed}

A key limitation of the model concerns the partial observability of streaming revenues that are individually managed, particularly on the publishing side and, in some jurisdictions, on the neighbouring rights side. Public data sources do not provide a complete view of how streaming revenues are allocated across all rightsholders, as significant portions may be licensed directly rather than through collective management organisations.

For this reason, the model operates primarily on collectively managed shares of streaming revenues, as these are the components that can be observed, reported, and reconciled with reasonable confidence. While this implies that total streaming value may be understated in some contexts, the approach remains suitable for comparative analysis as long as the scope of observation is applied consistently across uses and territories.

### Publisher Direct Licensing

Publisher direct licensing further affects the visibility of authors’ revenues, particularly in digital and streaming markets. Where publishers license rights directly to platforms, the resulting revenues do not appear in CISAC-aligned collective management data and are therefore absent from the observed authors’ revenue aggregates.

This limitation does not invalidate the comparative use of the model, provided that it is clearly acknowledged and treated consistently. The market comparator model compares observed revenues to observed or estimated quantities within a defined scope. As long as the scope excludes directly licensed revenues in a systematic way, the inferred prices and comparisons remain meaningful within that scope, even if they do not represent the full economic value of all music uses.

### Producer / Performer Split {#sec-producer-performer-split}

In the Livonian example, a simplified split between producers’ and performers’ neighbouring rights revenues is assumed, for instance on a 50:50 basis. This simplification is introduced to keep the synthetic example tractable and to avoid introducing country-specific contractual detail that would obscure the methodological demonstration.

It is important to stress that this split is a modelling parameter, not a normative or legal assumption. Different countries apply different rules, contractual practices, and institutional arrangements to the allocation of neighbouring rights revenues. Users applying the model to real data are expected to replace this simplified split with authorised and context-specific information where available.

### Country-Specific Institutional Differences {#sec-pilot-institutional-differences}

Rights management structures vary significantly across countries. Differences include the number of collecting societies, the degree of separation or consolidation between authors’ and neighbouring rights, and the balance between collective and individual management. These institutional variations affect how data are produced, reported, and accessed.

In this pilot study, such differences are deliberately abstracted in order to focus on the core logic of the market comparator model. The synthetic Livonian case represents a simplified but plausible institutional configuration. In practical applications, local adaptation will be required to map national data sources into the common structure used by the model. The replication strategy outlined earlier is designed to support such adaptations without altering the underlying analytical framework.
