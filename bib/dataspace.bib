abstract="A dataspace is an emerging approach to data management which recognises that in large-scale integration scenarios, involving thousands of data sources, it is difficult and expensive to obtain an upfront unifying schema across all sources. Data is integrated on an ``as-needed'' basis with the labour-intensive aspects of data integration postponed until they are required. Dataspaces reduce the initial effort required to set up data integration by relying on automatic matching and mapping generation techniques. This results in a loosely integrated set of data sources. When tighter semantic integration is required, it can be achieved in an incremental ``pay-as-you-go'' fashion by detailed mappings between the required data sources. This chapter introduces dataspaces and the fundamentals of ``best-effort'' data management.",

However, there has been limited work on the use of dataspaces within smart environments and the necessary support services for real-time events and data streams. This chapter introduces the Real-time Linked Dataspace (RLD) as a data platform for intelligent systems within smart environments. The RLD combines the pay-as-you-go paradigm of dataspaces with linked data, knowledge graphs, and (near) real-time processing capabilities. The RLD has been specifically designed to support the sharing and processing of data between intelligent systems within smart environments. We propose a set of specialised dataspace support services to enable the requirements of loose administrative proximity and semantic integration for event and stream systems. These requirements form the foundation of the techniques and models used to process events and streams within the RLD.",

	title = {Culture Data Space: A Case Study in Federated Data Ecosystems},
	abstract = {In several national and even continental data strategies worldwide, the decentralized data space concept aims to address concerns of data sovereignty among organizations. A significant number of projects and a few already operational data spaces address application domains in industrial domains such as manufacturing, mobility and logistics, or health. However, data sovereignty has also become a key concern of artists and cultural institutions who are pursuing the two-pronged and sometimes conflicting goals of creating added value from data sharing, and protecting their intellectual property and personal privacy rights. Additional challenges of this sector include an orders-of-magnitude larger number of potential players compared to existing data spaces, frequently limited {IT} capabilities, a complex differentiated system of data types and regulations, and a novel interplay between heterogeneous data integration and analytics with human creativity, among many others. Also, the different evolution paths of the involved sub-communities require a sophisticated concept for federated data space evolution. This keynote talk reports experiences of the ”Data Space Culture”, a lighthouse project of the German Chancellors Office aiming at investigating these issues and demonstrating and evaluating a suitable data ecosystem around four use cases in the fields of theaters, museums, music training, and networking local culture communities. We also discuss the potential synergies and interoperation challenges with the many other culture digitization initiatives in Europe and beyond.},

  abstract = {Access to data collected by the private sector could help local administrations to comply with their public-interest mission. Privately held data access by public bodies, however, is an emerging field with no established praxis yet. Its in-the-making status makes it a compelling subject for a research on the “politics of data”, since it allows looking at the power (un)balances between the companies holding data and the local administrations interested in it as well as citizens’ role. The contribution discusses the findings of a qualitative exploratory research that investigated the experiences and perspectives of local administrations regarding access to privately held personal data. Semi-structured interviews have been conducted with the innovation/data managers of twelve European local administrations. The interviews allowed contextualizing concrete experiences of data sharing in the discourses and viewpoints of the specialists working in this area, as well as the strategies they plan to put forward for facilitating access. The study illustrates how these cities’ managers experience four operational modes to access private data: data donorship, public procurement of data, data sharing partnerships and tender obligations. The results highlight new divides caused by the unequal possibilities to access private data, as cities with more experience and better reputation are in a favorable position both to establish partnerships and receive data at no cost. The findings also suggest that public managers would like to retain sovereignty of data, co-create instead of acquire data- driven solutions, and that are imagining collective forms of negotiation to enhance their access to private data.},

One challenging data management issue is how to disseminate data to relevant consumers efficiently. This chapter leverages semantic technologies, such as linked data, which can facilitate machine-to-machine communications to build an efficient stream dissemination system for Semantic IoT. The system integrates linked data streams generated from various collectors and disseminates matched data to relevant consumers based on user queries registered in the system. We design two new data structures to suit the needs of high-performance linked data stream dissemination in the following two scenarios: (1) stream dissemination in point-to-point systems; and (2) stream dissemination in wireless broadcast systems. The evaluation of the approaches using real-world datasets shows that they can disseminate linked data streams more efficiently than existing techniques.",

This chapter first discusses how this requirement is addressed with the help of catalogs in dataspaces; it then details how entity data can be more effectively managed within a dataspace (and for its users) with the use of an entity management service. Dataspaces provide a data co-existence approach to overcome problems in current data integration systems in a pay-as-you-go manner. The idea is to bootstrap the integration with automated integration, followed by incremental improvement of entity consolidation and related data quality. The catalog and entity management services are core services needed to support the incremental data management approach of dataspaces. We provide an analysis of existing data catalogs that can provide different forms of search, query, and browse functionality over datasets and their descriptions. In order to cover the entity requirements, the catalog service is complemented with an entity management service that is concerned with the management of information about entities.",

  abstract = {Lately governments and companies began experimenting with voluntary data sharing of business data for addressing public problems (so-called Data Collaboratives). This early practice revealed a number of challenges impeding business-to-government (B2G) data sharing and thus limiting the potential of data to provide answers and guide policies and action. One of the key challenges is the lack of a clear regulatory framework for B2G data sharing. To tackle this issue, the European Commission is taking regulatory action and preparing the Data Act which aims to spell out the rules and conditions for B2G data sharing for public interest. These developments, however, are met with resistance. While there is a strong push from the public sector for more private sector data, the private sector is less enthusiastic about the prospective mandatory B2G data sharing. In our study we zoom in on this issue in more detail and pose the following research question: How do public and private sector actors in the European Union view the prospect of mandatory B2G data sharing for public interest? To answer this question, we analyze the open dataset of responses to the public consultation of the European Commission. We find statistically significant results of business opposition to regulatory action and to mandating B2G data sharing, particularly among telecom and finance sectors. We also conclude that opposition to mandatory data sharing varies depending on the public interest purpose and is lowest among businesses with regards to emergencies and highest with regard to education, inclusion, and statistics.},

In this perspective, business-to-government (B2G) data sharing can benefit the social good and allow for better policy decisions. Nevertheless, the possibility for the public sector to access privately-held data remains mostly unexplored. This contribution aims to explore the possible evolution of B2G sharing models within the future systems of data governance by evaluating rationales to foster government access to privately-held data and by analysing some of the barriers that hinder this kind of exploitation. This essay then seeks to present models of B2G data circulation through which societal benefits and data sharing could be improved; specifically, it focuses on the options of voluntary and mandatory B2G data sharing and outlines concrete experiences of B2G data sharing between private entities and European local administrations.},
