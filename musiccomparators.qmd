In our valuation, we must not claim that an antitrust authority would use the same definition, but we argue that should such an investigation take place, it should result in a very similar definition of substitutability and geographical availability. There are definitions that are similar to the relevant market definition.

-   Functional comparability (from transfer pricing/TP): looks at the functions, risks, and assets involved in a transaction.

-   Technology classification (e.g., IPC codes): can give superficial similarity but ignores market demand and pricing power.

-   Royalty rate databases comparisons. In a way, we combine this with the ‘relevant market concept’ in our existing methodology.

::: callout-note
*We are ready to drop the relevant market definition if we receive a methodology sounder and operationalised different comparison methodology, for example, from the economics of transfer pricing, provided it can be well understood in the context of licensing music and it can be operationalised with existing data sources.*

Radio stations, TV, YouTube, and streaming platforms compete for consumer attention. When a user listens to music in a car, they are not listening to the radio; when watching YouTube, they are not watching television. Similarly, when a vinyl record is played, the digital radio is not on.

Our full-market comparator model extends the market comparator model of PWC, connecting the entire US and European music value chain models. These models traditionally divide the music industry by three revenue streams: live music, publishing, and recording. We incorporated all three revenue streams’ licensing income into the model.

The public performance model has different pricing standards for live music, publishing, and recording. We translated revenues from these income streams into notional hourly royalty figures, comparing live performance revenues with a similar currency unit per-hour format. Notably, live music only uses the public performance model, playing a relatively minor role in the live music ecosystem. Our focus is on the recording and publishing side.

Both the mechanical licensing and public performance models are internationally harmonized, making them easy to replicate for any year or licensing territory. The mechanical licensing model, used for physical products, digital downloads, and home copying, involves lump sum payments, while home copying compensation is annualized. Streaming, on the other hand, combines elements of both mechanical licensing and public performance models.

Price observation in public performance licenses is challenging. Traditional blanket licenses cover any use for a set period, with collective management organizations distributing revenues based on transaction logs or samples. Our approach calculates an implied hourly price per user.

The streaming model is hybrid, requiring licenses from both publishing (mechanical licensing) and public performance. To compare these with other revenues, we translate streaming revenues into hourly figures.

## Music comparator

We work with revenues as

$$
revenue = price * quantity
$$

$$
revenue = r_{author} + r_{producer} + r_{performer}
$$ Music has value for the end-user and the interim business user (for example, a restaurant or a concert promoter who pays a public performance license); the breakup of revenues among authors, producers and performers is indifferent for the enduser. Often, we have information only about author's revenues, and often we only have information about the sum of the three rights. However, because a licensed use requires all rights to be respected, or general equation is:

$$
r_{author} + r_{producer} + r_{performer} = (p_{author} + p_{producer} + p_{performer})*quantity
$$

The one-stop-shop in public performance aims to ensure that both rights are paid; streaming providers also have contractual arrangements to pay both the author's or publishing side and recording side (producers and performers.) We know that in Slovakia this relationship does not always hold, because the one-stop-shop is not working properly. Nevertheless, in many cases we must assume that it works. Especially when we are survying end-users, they do not understand the structure of author's rigths and neighboring rights, and they cannot tell if all three licenses are in order.

## General considerations

In Hungary, between 2014 and 2019, we followed a highly regulated process when conducting the national Cultural Access and Participation surveys, based on an agreement with the Hungarian competition authority. To avoid legal uncertainty, we literally followed the ESSNet Guidelines, which were not specifically designed for music but for general cultural activities. We constructed model questions based on this methodological document and its annex on model questionnaire building.

In our view, these model questions are not optimal for music participation because, compared to museum or gallery visits, book reading, or theatre attendance, music is ubiquitous. While many cultural activities have a median (typical) value, with an annual 0 or 1 value published as quantities, music listening activities can easily exceed the number of days. This led to a complicated survey setup in Hungary (and in Slovakia and Croatia for comparison purposes), which worked particularly poorly in Croatia, where the survey was administered via CATI instead of CAPI.

To adjust for the possibility that certain forms of listening activities—like playing a vinyl record on the family turntable—happen only a few times a year, a month, or a week, while listening to music on the radio during a daily commute happens nearly every working day, we allowed respondents to provide answers in the following formats:

-   3 hours a year, which we took at face value

-   2 hours a month, which we annualized by multiplying by 12

-   1 hour a week, which we annualized by multiplying by 50

-   2 hours a day, which we annualized by multiplying by 250

To clarify our model, we were interested in the ratios of music listening, not necessarily in true hourly quantities, so we didn’t mind potential distortions. In fact, we wanted to avoid giving stakeholders the false impression of precise quantification. Our multipliers were justified by the following considerations:

-   Weekly activities should not be multiplied by 52 because, during Christmas or holiday weeks, people have different routines.

-   When recalling daily activities, people likely think of a “typical day,” which is a working day, not a family Sunday gathering or a vacation day. We opted for a conservative multiplier because we tended to get rather high values.

Essentially, our methodology caused extra work in fieldwork programming and quantifying the results because we had to perform two additional tasks:

-   Convert all answers to annualized notional hours

-   Filter improbable answers that often contradicted the interview or resulted in extremely high values. We used various outlier detection and modification techniques because we didn’t want to overreport music use.

Agreeing with what Joost and Arianna said, the shorter the recall period, the better, and we think that the SINUS CAWI solution is a good starting point. It asks respondents to recall the day before, which is superior to our model, but there are several challenges with this implementation. First, it requires a scientific explanation backed by facts to justify this deviation from the ESSNet document, which is often seen by stakeholders as authoritative. Unfortunately, we did not have a survey specialist on our team to make this explanation. However, based on many years of surveying experience (including data from 10 CAP surveys), we believe we can easily build this argument.

The change to asking about one specific day, the day before, is not without trade-offs. Cultural activities are cyclical, with annual, weekly, and daily seasonality. This is not easily handled in a CAPI survey, especially if the survey is only administered on weekdays (creating a blind spot for Fridays and Saturdays, which are peak activity days for certain cultural activities important for our model). This also leads to sparsity in responses for niche uses, like using microcassette tapes or vinyl recordings.

In previous consultations, we agreed to simplify the Hungary and Slovakia CAPI surveys. We are not particularly focused on mechanical licensing (which is difficult to ask about due to the ever-growing number of devices that can hold private copies, licensed copies, and illegally copied copies of music or audiovisual works), but instead, we aim to assess music use quantities with a focus on public performance licensing. Because we do not need to connect the public performance listening mode to devices, the problem of sparse responses (e.g., few people using a turntable with vinyl on a daily basis) is less pronounced. However, public performance enjoyment hours are still subject to monthly, weekly, and daily life activity cycles.

Addressing this issue requires expert judgement, and it really relies on how the sample frame is designed and administered. As we all know, there are no truly random CAPI or CATI surveys available on the market because they are prohibitively expensive. A truly random CAPI survey would ensure that we meet every citizen in the sample with an equal chance, and the interview (if we use the day-before recall) has an equal chance of being administered on Monday or Sunday, in the morning or the afternoon. Given the cyclical nature of cultural participation, the formulation of the question is ultimately a judgement call made by those colleagues who design the survey questionnaire, administration, and sampling.

The following considerations must be taken into account:

-   [ ] A lot of licensed streaming and mechanical licensing use (i.e., files downloaded or buffered on a device) takes place during weekdays, on the commute to work or school.

-   [ ] Some public performance, particularly radio listening, takes place on weekdays, mainly in cars during the commute.

-   [ ] Certain types of public performance take place only on weekdays, in workplaces, canteens, and self-service restaurants, where music is used to isolate people from noise and clutter.

-   [ ] Certain types of public performance (in cafés, bars, churches, music clubs, etc.) almost predominantly take place on Fridays and Saturdays, with some niches focused on Thursdays and Sundays.

There are several ways to address this problem while keeping the recall time as short as possible:

-   [x] For infrequent events, ask about the last event visited (such as a live music performance), ask about that event, and inquire about the time elapsed since the event, which will indirectly provide us with visiting frequencies.

-   [x] If responses are distributed evenly from Monday to Sunday, recalling the day before is the best solution.

-   [ ] If responses are not evenly distributed from Monday to Sunday, the best approach is to ask about the last weekend and the day before, to capture answers for both a working day and a weekend (as the majority of the workforce does not work on weekends).

#### Affected parts of the questionnaire

The issue above is only critical in the SINUS CAWI Q33-Q34, and the former Hungary CAP 20215 xxx/xxx questions.
:::

In the earlier CEEMID valuations, particularly in Hungary where we had the highest research budget, we conducted in-depth ICET/CAP surveys. In the 2019 Hungary CAP survey, we quantified the enjoyment of mechanical copies of music in greater detail. In these scenarios, we aimed to identify which devices were used, as the focus of our research was to understand the prevalence, volume, and usage of licensed private copies, as well as "illegal" copies.

This focus is not central to our research in 2025, so we do not need to break up the questionnaire to the same extent. When mechanical licensing is the focus, technology plays a crucial role: for example, a vinyl record can only be played on a turntable, and a Spotify subscription requires an internet-connected device. If we are not focusing on the type of copies, we do not need to delve into these technology-driven cases. Additionally, in the Hungary and Slovakia CAP surveys, we aimed to measure both music and audiovisual use, which is not necessary for our current research. As a result, we can treat devices with screens as having a singular use (enjoying music), without the need to separate their use between watching audiovisual content, reading, gaming, and listening to music.

In the OpenMuse 2025 HU and SK surveys, we aim to capture the following variables.

```{r qmechanic, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
listen_variables_m <- expand.grid(
  situation = c("at home", "at work", "while travelling"),
  activity = c("listen"), 
  carrier = c("file","CD", "casette", "music in radio")
)

listen_variables_m <- listen_variables_m %>%
  mutate_all(as.character) %>%
  mutate (var = paste0(activity, "_", 
                       carrier, "_",
                       snakecase::to_snake_case(situation))
          ) %>%
  mutate ( question = paste0("Q14", 11:(10+nrow(.))))

listen_variables_music <- kbl(
  listen_variables_m) %>%
  add_header_above(c("license" = 3, "variable" = 2))

# Save the table as an HTML file to use with webshot2
html_file <- "listen_variables_music_output.html"
writeLines(as.character(listen_variables_music), html_file)

# Use webshot2 to capture the HTML file as a PNG
if (!knitr::is_latex_output() |
    !knitr::is_html_output()) {
  webshot2::webshot(html_file, 
                  here::here("png", "listen_variables_music_table.png"), 
                  selector = "table")
  knitr::include_graphics(
    here::here("png", "listen_variables_music_table.png"))
  }
```

Recalling music enjoyment is challenging because music serves different purposes in various environments. People often play music with the intent of making it the focus of their attention (foreground music), particularly when they want to listen to specific tracks. In other cases, music acts as an emotional booster, with listeners seeking a particular tempo, volume, and genre. There are also instances when music is used as background noise to create an atmosphere conducive to work, travel, or socializing.

From a licensing perspective, the purpose of music use is irrelevant; composers, performers, and producers should be compensated regardless of whether their music is used to motivate someone during monotonous physical exercise or to dampen the noise of people eating, drinking, and laughing at other tables. However, not everyone would categorize all of these uses as "music listening." Many people associate the term with a high-status, cultural activity, such as placing a vinyl recording of Bartók's symphonies on a turntable. Therefore, in our quantitative questionnaire, we encourage respondents to consider a broader context for music use by including simple situational qualifiers (e.g., `at work`, `while traveling`, `at home`). A third context, attending a music performance (where music is in the foreground) and other entertainment events (where music is in the background), is addressed with separate questions.
