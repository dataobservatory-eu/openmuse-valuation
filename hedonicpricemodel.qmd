# Hedonic price and related models {#sec-hedonicpricemodel}

This approach builds on the logic of hedonic price models and comparative indices such as the *Big Mac Index*. A Big Mac, or a simple coffee or beer, represents a relatively homogeneous product across wide geographic areas. The price differences of these items between locations (e.g., Bratislava and Amsterdam) usually reflect differences in real estate costs, wages, taxes, and other location-specific factors.

Similarly, the price of a simple coffee or a standard serving of beer is largely determined by the cost of inputs and the establishment’s overhead. Variations in serving prices thus capture differences in rental costs, staff wages, local purchasing power, and both the material and immaterial qualities of the venue—including the presence and quality of music.

We define two primary price equations for the cheapest available coffee and a standard-sized beer (0.3–0.5l). For beer, wholesale price differences are typically minimal (especially in Central Europe, where InterBrew and other large breweries dominate), making it a suitable homogeneous benchmark product.

$$
price_{coffee} = price_{base} + a_{1} + a_{2} + a_{3} + a_{4} + music_{present} + music_{quality} + ε
$$

We used to work with two homogeneous products, the cheapest coffee available on the menu, and the 0.3, 0.4 or 0.5l servings of beer. Most of the beers offered in Slovakia and Hungary are InterBrew products, some come from local breweries, but generally we can handle the difference of beer wholesale prices easily.

$$
price_{beer} = price_{base} + a_{1} + a_{2} + a_{...} + a_{n} + music_{present} + music_{quality} + ε
$$

-   `price_base`: underlying wholesale/input price\
-   $a_{1\ldots4}$: establishment and locational attributes\
-   `music_present`: presence/absence of music (binary)\
-   `music_quality`: proxy for curation, type, or live performance\
-   $\varepsilon$: error term with *E(ε) = 0*

The price difference of served products should be related to various, quantifiable factors, such a purchasing power and tourist nights in the location, distance from nearest population center, the presence of music and a random ε difference element which should have an expected value of 0. (It is not a problem if our equation is not correctly guessing the price for each restaurant, but it should overestimate as many places as it underestimates.)

If possible, we can differentiate between music quality, too; we can treat places that use commercial radio and streaming services with advertisement differently than curated background music.

Our aim is not necessarily the direct assignment of a price component to music, but to understand the differences among the places that pay different amounts of money for licensing music.

Again, this method in itself is not sufficiently detailed to establish the fair value or the price of the music, but it is a strong enough indicator of significant pricing differences. It can be used within one country or across borders. It would be particularly interesting to have a comparison between HU, SK, and perhaps some data points from other countries. BG and PL can also include data points in this work.

#### Review of the methodology {.unnumbered}

> While the logic behind the Hedonic Pricing Model (HPM) is straightforward, its empirical implementation is complex, as the estimations are often affected by several econometric issues, such as multicollinearity among attributes, omitted variable bias, reverse causality, and measurement errors. For instance, venue characteristics are typically highly correlated, and even with a comprehensive dataset, it is very difficult to account sufficiently for all potentially relevant variables. Implementing the model with experimental variations—such as changing the type of music—can help mitigate some of these identification challenges. However, experiments alone do not guarantee a strong identification strategy capable of yielding causal, or even robust, estimates. Without careful treatment of endogeneity, estimates may be biased, making it difficult to determine the magnitude or direction of the effects. Moreover, the generalizability of results to other settings or countries is not straightforward.
>
> To the extent these technical limitations can be overcome, hedonic price estimations provide valuable information about the value the use of music may generate for professional users. This would then provide an upper bound for the willingness to pay such professional users would have when negotiating with a monopolistic supplier and without the possibility of input substitution (which, against the backdrop of AI-generated music, seems an increasingly problematic condition). This can be described as the ‘deprival value’ of the music use in these cases. However, it is not straightforward how this can be translated to normative claims about ‘fair’ remuneration, as a deprival value is unlikely to deserve this epithet.

## Data needs

-   **Price Data**: Record the cheapest coffee and beer prices per establishment (online menus or on-site observation via photographed price cards).

-   **Establishment Data**: Identify venues, whether they are licensed for music use, and collect objective attributes (size, location, opening hours).

-   **Sample Definition**: It is not necessary to cover all licensed establishments, but samples should have clear boundaries (e.g., only Budapest cafés, only certain restaurant types).

-   **Music Use**: We must know whether the venue plays music and, if possible, its licensing status. Both music and non-music establishments are needed in the sample.

#### Consultation: Comparative Data {.unnumbered}

-   SOZA will provide access to CRM to well-defined HORECA types, with their address, fees paid, and other important metrics.
-   Artisjus, ZAiKS, MusicAutor and other societies are requested to provide us with representative comparative data.

#### Representative data (from surveys): {.unnumbered}

-   Anonymised or not anonymised data on restaurant-like, and hotel-like establishments meeting certain size and star-rating categories.

-   If they are not anonymised, the researchers will look up their public data, including price data, and record it for us (address, price of beer, coffee)

-   If they are anonymised, we will ask you to select from your CRM restaurants from certain locations, such as the city of Plovdiv or Debrecen for comparability.

*We must know if the place is licensed for use of music, or if the place is known to play music. We need establishments with and without music in the sample*.

## Potential Variables

::: callout-warning
#### Methodological Caution {.unnumbered}

Designing a hedonic price model for cafés and restaurants requires careful **pre-selection of variables**. The potential variables listed above are strongly correlated with each other, and the presence of multicollinearity, measurement error, and omitted variable bias can significantly distort the results.

It is *not possible to determine in advance* which variables will prove useful or statistically significant in explaining price differences without exploratory analysis and variable reduction techniques.

This means that: -

A pilot study is essential to test variable behavior, for this purpose, to a limited extent, the Artisjus, SOZA, Reprex background can be used; also, it is likely that SSSA's anonymous data collection can be useful for establishing some of the final variables. 

- Data collection should prioritize *consistent measurement* over sheer volume of variables.

- The final model will likely include a reduced set of predictors chosen based on statistical performance and theoretical relevance.

- Sensitivity analyses should be run to check robustness to different specifications.

This limitation does not invalidate the approach but underlines the importance of *careful variable selection and model diagnostics* before drawing conclusions about the role of music in pricing.

## Measuring the Variables

To operationalize the potential variables, we need a combination of field data, online sources, and administrative datasets. Different variable groups require different collection methods:

### Establishment-Specific Variables

-   **Self-administered survey to establishments**: Ask about music branding, licensing status, and sound system characteristics.

-   **Photo/video documentation**: Useful for later coding of sound system quality and ambiance.

### Menu Variables

-   **Menu data extraction**: Manual coding of menu focus (food vs. drink), number of drink items, and whether a service charge is included.\
